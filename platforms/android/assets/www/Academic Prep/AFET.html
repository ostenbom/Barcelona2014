        Enlargement policy as the EU’s strongest foreign policy tool? In light of Turkey’s ongoing oppression of popular opposition, how can the EU best use
        the country’s accession talks to encourage sustainable democratisation processes and respect for human rights?
    </em>
</p>

    <em>Chairperson: Saga Erikson - Finland</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevance of the Topic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The prospect of joining the EU has been used as an incentive structure for less developed European countries to democratise and stabilise the region in
    order to gain entrance to the single market. In 1993 this structure was specified through the creation of the Copenhagen Criteria, which set out the
    political, economic and legislative conditions for a country wishing to accede to the EU. We can see the success of enlargement policy particularly in the
    cases of Balkan countries such as Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, who have recently become members after reforms to their democratic institutions. Through
    this the EU has managed to create neighbouring countries with similar values of freedom and democracy, and has extended its sphere of influence by inviting
    these countries into the Union. This has expanded the EU’s influence as an international player, with the hope of also legitimising it as a voice for the
    entirety of Europe.
</p>
<p>
    However, the procedure of enlargement and negotiating accession have not been easy and with many countries has taken decades with little progress being
    made. The most pertinent example of this is Turkey. Turkey’s road to EU membership has its roots in its application to join the European Economic Community
    in 1987, which eventually in 1995 led to a customs union between Turkey and what had then become the EU. In 1999 at the Helsinki Summit Turkey’s status as
    a candidate country to join the EU was recognised. However due to the slow pace of Turkish reforms, and from the EU side the difficulty in ratifying
    financial aid to Turkey as well as the European Commission’s failure to meet commitments to secure the free movement of workers, meant that formal
    accession negotiations were only started in 2005. This came after the rise to power of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) party in Turkey who pushed
    forward with more reforms in the early 2000’s. Since then, however, only 13 chapters out of 35 of the community acquis have been opened and one
    provisionally closed. Several chapters remain blocked by countries such as Cyprus and France due to their unwillingness to let Turkey join the EU. The
    issue of Turkish occupation of the Northern part of Cyprus means the EU is also blocking the opening of 8 chapters because of trade restrictions on Cyprus
    from Turkey. The case of Turkey is an example of how accession talks have not yet been used to their full potential, as the EU response to violent
    repression of the Gezi park protests was slow and made little difference. Enlargement policy offers needed leverage to make change in Europe’s neighbouring
    countries but how can it be used more effectively when dealing with democratic deterioration in cases such as Turkey?

    <strong>Key questions:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · How has the EU enlargement policy been used in the past to achieve foreign policy goals?
</p>
<p>

<p>
    · Is it better to reward Turkey with further opening of chapters of the acquis prior to progress in order to encourage it or to threaten to stop
    negotiations if progress within a certain timeframe is not seen?

<p>
    <strong>Key conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In order to effectively use accession talks as a tool to foster more support for democratic reform in Turkey, there must first be a uniform stance on where
the EU stands on the possibilities of accession after Turkey has fulfilled criteria to join. Several Member States have expressed that    <strong>even if all chapters</strong> of discussion of Turkish accession were <strong>closed they would still oppose Turkish membership</strong> to the EU.
    This affects how much <strong>political will</strong> there is within the <strong>Turkish government</strong> to carry out reforms if what is promised at
    the end may never be materialised. This also puts a strain on the <strong>credibility of using accession talks</strong> as tool as it diminishes the value
of accession for Turkey if they believe the chance of it is minimal. Further, if the general <strong>attitude towards Turkey</strong>    <strong>within Member States</strong> is hostile and Turkey is not seen as a part of Europe, this will also affect in what light Turkey will see its own
    chances of accession and the role it can play in the EU. These are all conflicts that weaken the only tool the EU has to use to pressure Turkey for more
democracy and respect for human rights. However, Turkish political will is not only influenced by the EU’s stance on its accession, but also by    <strong>domestic players</strong> who may be pro- or anti-EU depending on how they perceive their gains. The Turkish political party in power, the AKP, may
    be unwilling to carry out democratic reforms that would diminish their ability to stay in power. Democratic reforms open up the political sphere to groups
    who can now demand for more change, and could through that help with demanding further reforms. Lastly, we must also examine how <strong>moral</strong> it
is for the EU to <strong>threaten to halt negotiations</strong> with Turkey over domestic unrest, when the<strong>EU itself has been inconsistent </strong>with its approach to Turkey and in some cases has <strong>yet to communicate</strong> to Turkey the    <strong>benchmark criteria</strong> for opening chapters. This is the case especially with <strong>chapters 23 and 24</strong> to do with Judiciary &amp;
Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom &amp; Security. If the options are to <strong>open chapters as an incentive</strong> for more change in Turkey,    <strong>continue to freeze negotiations</strong> further, or <strong>threaten</strong> with the possibility of <strong>abandoning negotiations</strong>
    altogether, which of these is likely to produce the most desirable result?

    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are a multitude of key stakeholders to do with this topic, one of the most obvious being the Turkish government who has been keen to join the EU, and
    especially in the early 2000’s the government carried out a multitude of reforms to further align with EU policy. In the last few years there have also
    been several rounds of judicial reforms and a new democracy package in 2013. In Turkey, the civil society and large businesses have an interest in joining
    the EU for more profits through free trade and have been able to gain more say in the political sphere through reforms. Individual Member States in the EU
    such as France and Cyprus have an interest in not allowing Turkey to join the EU. France is sceptical of the influx of immigrants and the consequences of a
    country with a majority Muslim population entering the EU. Cyprus is in a conflict with Turkey over the territory in Northern Cyprus and before this
    dispute is resolved would like to use the prospect of accession to the EU to pressure Turkey into a solution. The entities within the EU who can affect
    Turkey’s accession are mainly the Commission and within in it the Directorate General and Commissioner for Enlargement who have an interest in smooth
    negotiations and moving forward the process. They also manage the information and communication policy to do with enlargement and through that can affect
    public opinion. Citizens in Member States, and the weight they carry together through public opinion, are also stakeholders as in order for a country to
    accede to the EU all Member States must agree in accession and in some countries such as France this is decided through a referenda.

<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the structure of how a country can accede the EU the measures already in place that are important to highlight here are to do with reforms made
    in Turkey and efforts from the EU to move along negotiations. This is important in order to understand the context of what policy improvements can be used
    as leverage, whether it is economic, political or legislative. One of the most important reforms made recently in Turkey is the aforementioned democracy
    package passed in March 2013. The main features included in the package were legalising the publishing of Kurdish materials, political parties that receive
    more than 3% of the vote were know eligible for treasury funding, and there was new legislation on the freedom of expression. One of the key negotiating
    points between the EU and Turkey is to do with visa free access of Turkish citizens to the EU. Usually when a country becomes a candidate for accession
    visa restrictions are lifted however in the case of Turkey this was not done. A roadmap towards a visa free regime with Turkey has recently been
    established with a 3-year timeline throughout which the Commission will present reports to the European Council and Parliament on Turkish progress. Once
    all criteria have been fulfilled the Commission will present a proposal to the Council and Parliament on the amendment of EC Regulation 593/2001 lifting
    visa requirements. Even though many of the chapters of the community acquis remain blocked preventing further negotiations taking place, the Commissioner
    for Enlargement Stefan Füle has established the Positive Agenda with Turkey. Under the Agenda a broad range of issues such as political reforms, migration,
    trade and further support to alignment with the acquis are to be discussed. Working groups have been established for unopened chapters such as Right of
    Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services (3), Company Law (6) and Information Society and Media (10). In order for countries to meet to conditions for
    accession they often need financial and technical assistance: the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) is the program through which the EU
    provides this assistance. The second edition of the program, IPA II is for the period from 2014-2020 and has a budget of 11.7 billion euros. This can also
    be used to pressure countries by suspending the assistance provided through this.
