    <strong>THE COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS (EMPL)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        With the Confederation of Family Organisations in the EU (COFACE) naming 2014 as the year for 'Reconciling Work and Family Life', what can be done to
        strengthen single parents' position in the labour market, and to ensure that neither gender is financially punished for having children?
    </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Chairperson: Dorothea Weber - Germany</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The high unemployment rates in Europe has been a prominent topic for many years. 2014, the Year for ‘Reconciling Work and Family Life’, brings a pressing
    matter to the table: single parents’ position in the labour market. They are “one of the two groups with the highest risk of poverty, with the percentage
    at risk of poverty ranging from 28% in the Nordic countries to 34% in the North-Western countries”. This raises the question of responsibility; especially
    whether it should be the governments’ task to come to their rescue.
</p>
<p>
    The most recent data shows that 10.4% of households with children are run by single parents. Of these, only 1.2% are single-father homes and 9.1% are
    single-mother homes. Some would argue that these discrepancies result from factors such as the gender pay gap, gender roles, legislation and the access to
    contraception and abortion.

</p>
<p>
    Studies show that mothers with partners are much more likely to be employed than single mothers. This indicates that single mothers have to choose between
    taking care of their children and taking up a job. However, a job and the income connected to it are necessary for single parents to be able to afford
    services such as childcare or after-school care. Without a steady income they are dependent on state aid such as paid paternity and maternity leave or
    child benefits. In order to balance their children’s needs as well as their finances, many single parents take up part-time jobs.
</p>
<p>
    The issue of social exclusion is part of the topic employment and social policy, which is a shared competence between the EU and its Member States. Most
    policies are currently implemented on a national level while the EU has a complementing function.
</p>
<p>
    In order to tackle this issue, the first question that needs to be answered is whether a welfare state system with social benefits is a way forward or
    whether the responsibility lies with the single parents themselves. In other words: is it the Member States’, EU’s or any governments’ task to protect the
    groups at risk of poverty? What might the effects of state interference in the labour market be?

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The question that is essential to this topic is whether social benefits are something the EU and/or Member States should provide or whether single parents
    and other groups should be responsible for their own employment and therefore learn to cope without state aid. What it comes down to is the two opposing
    theories of free market economy versus social market economy.
</p>
<p>
    An aspect, which needs to be acknowledged, is the legislative situation. The EU has the competence to complement and support the Member States’ actions.
    The reason for this is the subsidiarity principle, which ensures that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen. Considering the great
    variety in the 28 Member States in terms of the composition of single-parent households, this does seem like a sensible concept.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, there are possibilities for the EU to act. The European Parliament can ensure that more data is collected on the matter so as to understand
    the situation better in order to provide legislation tailored to the situation. Another helpful tool is the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), which brings
    together Member States in order to work towards common objectives while the Commission takes on a surveillance role.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the European labour market is a complex system. It is not easily predictable what the support of one group might mean for another.
    Considering the amount of people in desperate need of employment, the question arises whether it would really be fair to support single parents rather than
    for instance youngsters in search for a job.
</p>
<p>
    Should the decision be made, however, to aid the single parents, then the question remains which measures might be appropriate? Many complain about a lack
    of flexible work opportunities, which would be ideal for people taking care of a child. Single parents could be given the chance to work part-time and be
    given the option of taking time off during school holidays. Other possible measures would be paid maternity and paternity leave as well as the further
    establishment of child-care and after-school care. This would give single parents more time and flexibility to (re)enter the labour market.

    <li>
        <strong>Council of the European Union – The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO): </strong>

</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Member States Governments: </strong>
        Are in charge of policy making in this field. They establish different benefits for single parents and have different viewpoints about state aid
        depending on the current government.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Single parents: </strong>
        They are clearly most interested in the matter. More support, be it financial or otherwise, is what they demand. They are also in need of more flexible
        job offers in order to manage both work and family life.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Employers: </strong>
        In times of high unemployment rates, employers have to choose amongst applicants for a job. They tend to perceive single parents as unreliable and
        prefer other applicants to them. <strong></strong>
