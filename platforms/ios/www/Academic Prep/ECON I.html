    Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as the backbone of Europe's economy: Given that European programmes for SME finance have failed to achieve a major
    pan-European breakthrough, what targeted initiatives to improve SME financing conditions should be implemented without unnecessarily distorting capital?
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Chairperson: Maria Pashi - Cyprus</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    It’s a commonly held belief that small and medium-sized enterprises are a centrepiece of Europe’s economy. There are 20 million SMEs in the EU, which make
    up 99% of all European businesses and provide two out of three of the private sector jobs. Thus, SMEs are crucial to the European employment and economic
    growth rates. Moreover, they are responsible for innovation, research and development and the creation of new products and markets.
</p>
<p>
    ‘They are a nursery for the larger firms of the future.’ As a SME grows in size more employees are hired, the product range expands and economic growth
    increases. Additionally, startup companies drive innovation in technology, create new products and markets, therefore, it is vital for the economy that
    they have adequate finance in order to develop their innovation.
</p>
<p>
    Since SMEs take up so much of the European economy, because of their great potential to grow, and also innovate and invest in research and development,
    their support towards growth is essential. A requirement for an SME’s growth, however, is having the financial support. Small businesses have only a small
    amount of finance to invest either due to inadequate profits or low starting capital. Unfortunately, many constraints and barriers exist that make it
    difficult for an SME to find the finance it needs to grow and invest.
</p>
<p>
    Financing an SME generally depends on its sector of activity and its growth cycle. In order to grow, a firm needs to be able to rely on equity and debt.
    Depending on the company’s age, industry, country and operations, the type of finance a SMEs seek vary.
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning of its growth cycle SMEs will use finance to start their business, from personal/family savings while more established SMEs use retained
    profits. As firms grow, external finance is needed and financial institutions, banks and investors are the primary source of finance.
</p>
<p>
    However, there are a number of structural market failures that restrict a viable SME with great growth and innovation potential, from accessing finance.
    The Rowlands Review estimates up to 3,000 viable SMEs each year with characteristics suitable for growth capital may be unable to raise any of the finance
    required for growth. A key barrier is that of asymmetric information between SMEs and finance providers, which creates a funding gap for SMEs with no
    performance track record or collateral. With the limited data that investors have about the track record of the company, investors cannot fully assess an
    SME’s potential returns or distinguish between low and high risk businesses. As a result, investors are hesitant to invest and become risk adverse and
    higher interests are set for SMEs or lenders decide to invest in larger businesses instead.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, even with the EU’s support the structural market failures have not been rectified. Since the financial crisis of 2008, SME lending has not
    fully recovered, with tighter banking regulations combined with the lack of reliable economic recovery making banks hesitant to lend to SMEs.
</p>
<p>
    With the financial crisis, SMEs’ challenges to access finance had worsen. With SMEs being highly vulnerable to economic downturns and with lending market
    paralysing, SMEs’ were hit the most by the financial crisis. Additionally, since then, new banking regulations were introduced in order to safeguard banks
    and the economy from future financial crisis through setting higher standards and regulations for banks to follow.
</p>
<p>
    Basel III agreement aims to strengthen the resilience of the EU banking sector in times of economic shocks while banks continue to finance economic
    activity and growth. Under Basel III banks need to have much higher capital requirements - which is challenging especially after the financial crisis. The
    new more restrictive capital requirements do not however apply to loans granted to SMES up to the amount of 1,500 00 euros thus does not restrict SME
    financing. For any bigger amounts however, it may mean that banks require personal guarantees from SMEs or even switch away from lending to SME’s
    altogether.
</p>
<p>
    National governments recognise the finance gap that SMEs face, thus intervene to fix this market failure and support SME though national initiatives.
    Examples include the Funding-f0r Lending (FLS) Scheme and Start-up Loans in the the UK, the KfW Entrepreneur Loan in Germany and the Contrat de
    Développement Innovation (CDI) in France.
</p>
<p>
    The EU recognises the importance of SMEs in the European economy and the financing issues that they have, thus tries supports them by providing grants,
    loans, guarantees, venture capital and other equity financing. Support is available either directly or through programmes managed on a national level.
    Additionally, innovative ways of finance, such as crowdfunding, are enabling more innovative SMEs to secure finance.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, viable SMEs, with great potential, lack the financial support they need in order to grow, innovate or even begin setting up their business. The
    result is great loss of potential in increasing economic grow, decreasing unemployment and driving innovation.

<p>
    <strong>Key Terms:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SME: </strong>
    Within the European Union, SMEs are defined as firms with a small market share, less than 250 employees and
</p>
<p>
    a turnover of less than €50 million annually.
</p>
<p>
    There are 3 types of SMEs:
</p>
<p>
    - Micro-enterprises have fewer than 10 employees
</p>
<p>
    - Small enterprises have between 10-49 employees
</p>
<p>
    - Medium-sized enterprises have between 50 and 249 employees
</p>
<p>
    (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Financial institutions: </strong>
    An establishment which provides financial services to its clients and members. Conventionally, financial institutions are composed of organisations such as
    banks, trust companies, insurance companies and investment dealers. Most financial institutions are regulated by the government.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Line of Credit: </strong>
    An arrangement between a financial institution, usually a bank, and a customer that establishes a maximum loan balance that the bank will permit the
    borrower to maintain. The borrower can draw down on the line of credit at any time, as long as he or she does not exceed the maximum set in the agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Funding Gap:</strong>
    The amount of money needed to fund the ongoing operations or future development of a business or project that is not currently provided by cash, equity or
    debt.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Financial intermediaries: </strong>
    An entity that acts as the middleman between two parties in a financial transaction. This category includes financial institutions such as investment
    banks, insurance companies and commercial banks. Financial intermediaries offer a number of benefits to the average consumer including safety, liquidity
    and economies of scale.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Business angel:</strong>
    A high net worth individual who provides financing to small businesses in exchange for an equity stake in the business. Business angels are often thought
    of as a bridge between loans from family and friends and venture capital.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Credit scoring techniques:</strong>
    This involves the use of statistical models by lenders to approve loans to SMEs by predicting the probability of default. Information on financial ratios
    (such as profitability, leverage and liquidity) and information on credit histories/ financial delinquency are used to predict the probability of default
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Venture Capital:</strong>
    Money invested in early-stage businesses with expected long-term potential growth. It typical means a high-risk for the investor but expects high-returns
    in the long-run. Most venture capitalists are groups of wealthy investors, investment banks and other financial institutions. The investor in return gets a
    portion of the equity and usually a say in the decisions concerning the company.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Grants</strong>
    : An amount of money given by governments, foundations, corporations, for a specific purpose. The person/business that receives the grant does not need to
    repay it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Loans</strong>
    : Giving money (or otherwise, providing debt), to a business or individual in exchange for future repayment plus interest rate. Usually individuals,
    financial institutions and governments give loans which are paid back in regular instalments plus interest rates - which is considered the lender’s profit.
    There are legal regulations as to how high the interest rate can be and the length of time before repayment is needed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Guarantee</strong>
    : A safeguard that the lender will be repaid In the case that a borrower is unable to repay the loan back. The guarantee takes the debt obligation if the
    borrower defaults. The loan can be guaranteed by a third-party like another individual or the government. Government guaranteed loans aim to assist
    people/business who have low creditworthiness. Additionally, in the case of mortgages, the property is the guarantor in case the borrower defaults.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Facts and Figures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Access to finance was the second most pressing problem mentioned by 15% of EU SME managers, only locating customers was a greater problem.
</p>
<p>
    When rated on a 10 point scale, the severity of the problem of getting access to finance was most pressing in Slovakia (42% of SMEs rating it as 10 out of
    10, i.e. extremely pressing), followed by Greece (28%) and Cyprus (26%). It was least likely to be judged as extremely pressing in Estonia (only 3%),
    Finland (5%) and the Czech Republic (5%) - http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/finance/files/2013-safe-analytical-report_en.pdf
</p>
<p>
    The percentages of SMEs reporting rejections of loan applications, loan applications for which only a limited amount was granted, and loan applications
    which were rejected by the SME because of too high borrowing costs, as well as the percentage of SMEs which did not apply for a loan for fear of rejection,
    gives a share of 12% (unchanged from the previous survey round) of euro area SMEs having reported that their loan applications were not successful in the
    period from October 2013 to March 2014.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A key implication that restricts SMEs’ finance greatly is lack of information. One barrier to finance is that the lack of information, deems the lender
    unable to distinguish between high and low risk investment and evaluate the true potential of growth that an SME can have. To avoid costs associated with
    gathering this information, lenders ask business to provide a financial track record and/or collateral as security for the finance. Since 2008, times of
    uncertain economic conditions, the banking market is more cautious about assessing risk. Unfortunately, since a lot of SMEs are small and young, although
    they be viable business propositions, with the lack of a track record or collateral, they are unable to secure funding. SMEs do not have audited financial
    statements that can be shared with any provider of outside finance. Some family-owned businesses, for example, are very reluctant to report strategic
    information such as business structure, growth opportunities, strategic orientation and even ownership structure. As a result, small firms are often unable
    to convey their status in a credible way, and have more difficulty building a reputation to signal their high quality as a borrower.
</p>
<p>
    Even in the occasion that the lender decides to assess the quality of an SME proposal, the costs of doing so are transferred to the SME as transaction
    costs, thus, increasing their burden when securing funding. Therefore, from the lender’s perspective, an investment in a larger, lower-risk business is
    wiser. Unfortunately, this leaves potentially viable businesses with growth potential not being able to obtain equity finance. The general lack of equity
    in the firm, the high risk, the lack of adequate collateral and poor information about the business restrict lenders from investing in SMEs. Although
    investing in SMEs in its early stage can bring about innovation and a number of positive spillover effects to the economy, investors do not take this under
    consideration when making their investment decisions. Their incentive is to make the most profit through the safest and risk-averse investments.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a great lack of information from the SMEs’ side. For instance, entrepreneurs and SMEs may not fully understand the potential growth and
    benefits of their business had they raised. Moreover, many SMEs are simply lacking the information on how equity finance works and where to obtain such
    finance from. Small businesses find it challenging to comply with European standards and find the procedure too complex. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    SMEs may also lack the managerial skills and can make poor business plans. This means that a lot of them fail to present themselves as a good investment
    even though their business might have the capacity to do so.
</p>
<p>
    There is gap between financial institutions and SMEs hindered even further by the lack of communication. Communication should not be limited to the reasons
    for not granting bank loans or withdrawing existing credit lines – it should be built upon mutual trust between banks and SMEs. SMEs are unaware of risk
    assessments and the factors leading to downgrading. They are many times unaware of the data needed to determine the rating, the factors affecting the
    credit decision and the possible ways to improve the rating.
</p>
<p>
    The assessment criteria of whether to invest or not, vary between Members States and between different institutions. Having said that, SMEs fail to seek
    finance from abroad, but rather remain nationally or locally. The European internal market represents 500 million consumers, but too many of our SMEs fail
    to look beyond the limits of their own national borders.

<p>
    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Entrepreneurs and SMEs </strong>
    seek for external finance in order to establish their business, expand it or invest in research and development. They seek this finance through private
    investors or <strong>financial institutions</strong> such as banks. They seek to make a profit through either buying part of the company they’re investing
    in and profiting through the business’s profits or by giving a loan and receiving interest rates for it. Either way, lenders want to maximise their profit
    in the least risky way. So, they seek for investments in business, which are not risky and have the smallest possibility to fail, and also the best
    potential for the company to grow greatly and quickly. Due to the fact that SMEs are usually young in age and lack the history to prove that they are not
    risky, it becomes very difficult for them to acquire the external funding. The <strong>EU</strong> recognises this market failure and recognises how
    important SMEs’ growth and development is for the Europe’s technological innovation, the shrinking of unemployment and the increase of the European
    economic growth. Thus, the <strong>European Commission (EC) </strong>develops and implements a range policies assisting SMEs to develop and thrive as well
    as to receive finance through grants, loans and work towards finding out what are the market failures and how they can be overcome. The EC constantly works
    with <strong>Member States</strong> to manage this funding and also gather information about current market failings and how they can be resolved in an
    innovative way.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In 2008, the European Commission launched the <strong>Small Business Act (SBA)</strong>, which is a policy framework, including legislative proposals,
    which aim to facilitate SME’s access to funding and assist them in thriving as a business. The European Commission’s activities based on SBA has been the
    SME Finance Forum, providing them with flexible financial instruments such as Eurobean Investment Bank (EIB) loans and an Action Plan in order to improve
    access to finacne for SMEs. This Action Plan includes the Horizon 2020 which combines all research and innovation funding, and the programme for
    Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME).
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>European Investment Bank (EIB)</strong> Group provides an additional €60bn in lending in order to support Europe’s economic recover. It
    finances SMEs through local partner banks, in favourable terms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The European Investment Fund (EIF)</strong>
    manages a range of EU financial instruments and is a provider of risk finance aiming support Europe's SMEs by helping them to access finance. The EIF does
    not lend nor grant subsidies to SMEs, rather it works through financial intermediaries in order assist SMEs with lending. For instance, can provide venture
    capital for small businesses and it can provide guarantees to financial institutions to cover their loans to SMEs. It uses either its own funds or those
    entrusted to it by the EIB or the European Union.
</p>

<img src="Images/image002.jpg" width="95%" />
<p>
    <strong>The programme for Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME)</strong>
    will facilitate and improve access to finance for SMEs through two different financial instruments, available from 2014:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Loan Guarantee Facility (SMEG)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The COSME budget will fund <strong>guarantees</strong> and <strong>counter-guarantees</strong> for financial intermediaries to help them provide more loan
    and lease finance to SMEs. This loan guarantees encourages banks to make more debt finance available to SMEs, including microcredit and mezzanine finance,
    by reducing the banks' exposure to risk. SMEG provides co-, counter- and direct guarantees to financial intermediaries providing SMEs with loans, mezzanine
    finance and equity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Equity Facility for Growth</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The COSME budget will also be invested in funds that provide venture capital and mezzanine finance to expansion and growth-stage SMEs in particular those
    operating across borders.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Horizon 2020</strong>
    is the EC's latest programme for research and innovation and aims at improving Europe's global competitiveness. One of its objectives is to strengthen
    innovation. This includes major investment in key technologies and greater access to capital and support for SMEs. The Specific Fields of Action, singles
    out specific aims that Horizon 2020 should strive for. This includes making sure that “the adequate participation of, and innovation impact on, small and
    medium-sized enterprises (SME) in Horizon 2020”.Thus the dedicated SME instrument, which takes up 7% of the total budge for Horizon 202, aims to fill gaps
    in funding for early-stage, high-risk, research and innovation by SMEs and also stimulate innovation.The new instrument will integrate the specific SME
    support that the EU Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP)
    had, in one comprehensive, simple and easily accessible scheme.
