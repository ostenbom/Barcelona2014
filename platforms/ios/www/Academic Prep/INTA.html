  <strong>  THE COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE (INTA) </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Opposition to certain aspects of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) continues to rise, highlighting concerns and slowing what
        was initially considered inevitable acceptance on both sides of the Atlantic. What position should the EU take towards the TTIP negotiations?
    </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Chair - Aida Grishaj - Albania</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In July 2013, the <strong>EU </strong>and the <strong>United States of America (USA) </strong>started negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) between
    them, which is set to create the largest free trade zone in the world: the <strong>Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)</strong>. The
negotiating parties are aiming to<strong>eliminate trade barriers, such as tariffs, regulations and quality standards regarding the production of goods</strong>. By<strong>opening new markets</strong> and <strong>increasing the exchange of goods and services</strong>, the EU and the US are hoping to    <strong>boost trade</strong>, employment and give new impulses to their struggling economies. The existing customs tariffs are low, however, removing them
completely will generate profits of billions of Euros for both, the EU and the US. The negotiations are focusing on<strong>making markets more accessible</strong>, <strong>dismantling unnecessary regulatory barriers</strong> and working on    <strong>new international standards</strong>.
</p>
<p>
When the project was launched, it was greeted on both sides of the Atlantic. Different parties pushed for the agreement to be signed    <strong>without any delays</strong>, so that the fragile economies would be able to <strong>benefit straight away</strong>. Nevertheless, as the
negotiations proceed, there is an <strong>increasing opposition</strong> towards the TTIP. Several non-governmental organisations    <strong>(NGOs), trade unions, environmentalists, and social justice organisations</strong> have expressed concerns that this agreement, by harmonising
regulations, will undermine and    <strong>lower Europe’s high standards regarding consumer, environmental and worker’s protection, food or technology safety and public services</strong>.
They claim that the negotiations <strong>lack transparency</strong> and that the EU is willing to sacrifice these standards in favour of    <strong>commercial benefits</strong> and <strong>lobbying groups</strong>. The European Commission (EC) on the other hand has continuously reassured that
    environment, health and safety, protection of privacy as well as workers' and consumer rights are <strong>non negotiable</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The relevance of this topic is not only limited to the parties signing it. There are several FTAs being negotiated between <strong>other players</strong>,
    like the one between the US and several Asian countries. These FTAs will also aim to harmonise standards and the standards set by TTIP have the potential
    to turn into a <strong>point of reference</strong> for them, making this agreement have larger <strong>global impacts</strong> than simply increase trade
    between the US and the EU.
</p>
<p>
    So the question revolves around what position the EU should take in these negotiations; whether to lean towards sacrificing European standards for greater
    economic openness, or whether our regulations and standards are too important to be lowered for the potential financial gains.

<p>
    <strong>Key terms:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Free trade zone: A free trade zone is composed of countries which have signed a free trade agreement (FTA) between them, according to which they impose a
    few or no tariffs or import quotas and preferences on most (or all) goods and services traded between them.
</p>
<p>
    · Free Trade Agreement: Countries signing a free trade agreement (FTA) agree upon eliminating tariffs and other barriers on goods and/or services traded
    between them and create this way a free trade zone.
</p>
<p>
    · Trade barriers: Trade barriers are measures introduced by governments or other public authorities, which aim making imported goods or services less
    competitive than goods and services produced in the country. These barriers pose restrictions on international trade and can be either tariffs or
    non-tariff barriers to trade.
</p>
<p>
    · Customs duty/tariff: It is a tax levied on imports (and, sometimes, on exports) by the customs authorities of a country to raise state revenue, and/or to
    protect domestic industries from more efficient or competitive companies from abroad. Many of the existing transatlantic tariffs are quite low, with the
    textile industry and financial services being the main exceptions.
</p>
<p>
    · Non-tariff barriers: Non-tariff barriers are an alternative to tariffs as means for one country to control the amount of trade that it conducts with
    another economy. The most common form of non-tariff barriers includes quotas, embargoes, sanctions and other restrictions.
</p>
<p>
    · Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP): It is the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) the EU and the US are planning to finalise by 2015 the
    latest.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are two main conflicts regarding the TTIP negotiations: the disputes between the parties themselves and the conflicts with different interest groups.
</p>
<p>
    The conflicts start with what should be included in the treaty. The US and the EU have notable differences in agricultural policies, financial sector
    regulations and data privacy. The US has insisted that the financial sector will not be part of the negotiations, whereas the EU insists on making it part
    of the agreement as it would make TTIP more consistent.
</p>
<p>
    The negotiating parties have to face opposition coming from NGOs, trade unions, environmentalist groups and the major dispute regarding standards.
    Opposition groups claim that harmonising regulations can only mean that the EU lowers its degree of protection. Otherwise, what would be the interest of
    American companies in the agreement? There have been concerns regarding GMOs and hormone treated food, which is allowed in the US but banned in the EU.
    Fracking practices and lower American requirements for environmental protection have also been in the centre of strong opposition. The EC has pointed out
    several times, that these standards are not in the table of the negotiations and that TTIP is only supporting them. The European Commission has been
    accused of lacking transparency on the negotiations and failing to clarify these concerns raised.
</p>
<p>
    Another point that has generated heated debates is the Investor - State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). Many groups fear that it will undermine some important
    democratic principles, as foreign companies might potentially have the right to intervene in and change national legislation by using the TTIP as a legal
    base in process disputes. Parties claim that this system needs reform and that European firms, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will benefit
    from it, without infringing democracy in any form.
</p>
<p>
    The NSA scandal also risked to damage the negotiations, as many European leaders threatened to stop the negotiations because of it. However, the
    negotiations still continue and were not slowed by the political tensions.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The EU is one of the parties negotiating the treaty with the US. The EU is represented by the European Commission in the negotiations. Other institutions
    playing a role are the European Parliament and the European Council. The Commission has to report to these two institutions on the progress of the
    negotiations. The other negotiating party is the government of the United States of America. Both the US and the EU are expecting large economic benefits
    from this agreement, so their objective is to reach an agreement on more than twenty sectors by the end of 2015.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the negotiating parties, NGOs, environmentalists and civil society in both the US and the EU will have a say, especially when it comes to
    safeguarding the standards in environmental, social and health issues. After being accused of lack of transparency, the EC launched several meetings with
    interest groups to receive feedback on what is being negotiated.
</p>
<p>
    The lobbying groups, mostly businesses and corporates will also have a say in speeding up the negotiations and reaching a final agreement by the end of
    next year and by doing so, having free access to the markets without barriers or unnecessary regulations hindering trade.
</p>
<p>
    Finally one would be remiss to consider the question without some appreciation of the American point of view. The American Government, including the House
    and Congress (which would have to ratify any agreement) are major stakeholders in such an agreement. Understanding their aims, and the aims of big business
    in America, will help the Committee get to the bottom to the vast amount of conflicting information and opinion that surrounds the topic.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to the TTIP itself, the negotiations are in full swing with the 5<sup>th</sup> round being concluded in May. Both parties are aiming to reach
    an agreement by 2015.
</p>
<p>
    The chapters of the negotiations have already been decided and are the following: agricultural and investment goods, government procurement, investment,
    energy and raw materials, regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, services, intellectual property rights, sustainable development, SMEs,
    dispute settlement, competition, customs facilitation and state owned enterprises. After five rounds of negotiations, there have been advances in achieving
    an agreement in regards to technical barriers to trade, competition, SMEs, sustainable development, labour, environment, energy and raw materials. For the
    first four a common text is expected soon.
</p>
<p>
    The EC has already had large consulting meetings with various interest groups, in an attempt to make the negotiations more transparent.
</p>
<p>
    The main initiatives to stop or oppose to TTIP have been several demonstrations and petitions from opposing groups. However, they did not slow or have a
    meaningful impact on the negotiations.
