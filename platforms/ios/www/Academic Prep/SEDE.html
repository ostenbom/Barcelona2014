    <strong>THE COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND DEFENCE (SEDE)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        In light of recent developments close to the EU’s borders, member states are rethinking cuts to military spending and the EU’s Common Security and
        Defence Policy (CSDP). How far should the EU go in becoming a 'hard power' actor, and develop capabilities akin to those deployed by NATO, whilst
        considering the necessity of duplicating these structures?
    </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Chairperson - Hugo Dürr – Sweden</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Up until 1945, Europe had not known peace. For millennia, Europe had been at war, somewhere, somehow. This came to an end, with the World War I and World
    War II, and since then, members of the EU have known peace, now for nearly 70 years. As a result, the democratic peace evokes a sense of security and
    stability, and for the sake of coping with austerity after the 2008 economic crisis, many Member States took measures to limit military spending and
    armament development. However, with the worryingly escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as growing tensions within Turkey and the unyielding civil
    war in Syria, Member States are reconsidering the decisions made to cut back on military spending. In addition, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy
    (CSDP) has come under critique recently due to its lack of legislative weight and incentive for Member States to utilise the policy. The absence of joint
    action since its formation and the promises and pledges that have not been acted upon fuel the criticism. Many worry about the instability in neighbouring
    regions, and suggest that Member States are at the moment “defenceless”. This pertains not only to the EU Member States; allies to the west, the United
    States, as well as NATO, who are concerned over the lack of hard EU security, as security in the EU means security for NATO. However, there are those that
    discuss whether the EU should react to the political events in neighbouring regions, if there a need for Europe to respond to conflict which arises outside
    the Union? To question further, how likely is it that there will be the need for European hard power capabilities? Is there even a threat worthy to defend
    against?<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Today, the Berlin Plus Agreement (see section 7. <em>Measures in Place</em>) outlines the cooperation, responsibilities and boundaries between the EU and
    NATO. Albeit a promising framework, the Berlin Plus has been <strong>criticised for its lack of influence and political weight</strong>, with it having
failed to ensure continuous strategic cooperation between NATO and the EU. This raises the question if the EU should    <strong>focus on developing its own structures</strong>, such as the CSDP, <strong>or if improving the existing NATO framework</strong> is the wiser
    option? Are the two alternatives mutually exclusive? What is clear at least, is that security and safety of its members are essential to both
    organisations; so how best to accommodate this? <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
Despite many arguments that highlight the <strong>importance of developing hard powers</strong>,    <strong>soft power has always been a key element of leadership</strong>, especially in the case of the EU. Skilful leaders have always understood the
    attractiveness that stems from <strong>credibility</strong> and <strong>legitimacy</strong> through, for example, diplomacy, foreign assistance, civic
    action and economic reconstruction; as the EU has advocated since its establishment. Power has never flowed solely from the barrel of a gun; even the most
    brutal dictators have relied on attraction as well as fear. The <strong>core of the European project </strong>was, from the beginning, peace, human rights
and diplomacy, and this represented the identity of the EU. This raises the debate of whether the identity of the EU is    <strong>ideologically incoherent</strong> with developing hard power military capacities.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The options that lay ahead in this issue are not as clear as they may seem; the <strong>ideological standpoint of opting for hard or soft power</strong> is
    not an absolute, there is considerable middle-ground. Opting to develop hard power does not directly signify increasing a military presence or even
    indicate an increase in spending, but rather a reallocation of funds, or development of already existing structures and measures. Nor does developing soft
    power entail that the EU simply continues as it is today, but rather could require a greater focus on diplomatic strength. There are several possible
    routes to explore.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, an important question that must be raised is <strong>who will ultimately answer</strong> for how Europe develops its armament:    <strong>the EU or the Member States</strong>? Would it be possible to coordinate between the differing foreign policies of Member States, bearing in mind
the varying mentalities, the impact of history, and the culture of military in Member States? There are several aspects to consider;    <strong>but must it be either the EU or Member States</strong> who answer? The decision to follow whichever course of action need not be taken at a
    pan-European level; there is the possibility of certain Member States or regions to work in one way and others in another: more concretely, some Members
    States might be encouraged to enlarge the defence budget, and others not.
</p>
<p>
There is no YES or NO answer to this issue; the discussion is primarily a <strong>fundamental ideological one</strong>, on the    <strong>identity of the EU</strong>, and thereafter the determination of “at which level” resolutions would be implemented.

    <strong>Key Terms:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Collective security</strong>
: the concept that aggression against a state should be defeated collectively because aggression against one state means aggression against all        <strong>.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sovereignty</strong>
        : the authority of the state, based on recognition by other states and by non-state actors, to govern matters within its own borders that affect its
        people, economy, security, and form of government.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Democratic peace</strong>
        <strong>theory</strong>
        : supported by empirical evidence that democratic states do not wage wars against each other, but to fight wars against authoritarian states.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hard power</strong>
        : a coercive approach to international political relations, especially one that involves the use of economic and/or military power.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Soft power</strong>
        : ability to change a target’s behaviour based on the legitimacy of one’s ideas or policies, rather than on material power e.g. economic or military.

    <strong> Key questions: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    • What are the issues with the EU’s foreign policy and the EU’s security and defence today? Are there any?
</p>
<p>
    • Which course of action should the EU follow: development of hard power capabilities, or soft power capacities?
</p>
<p>
    o If the favoured option is the development of hard powers, should it be on the initiative of the EU to develop hard power security and defence capacities
    in Member States? How would a hard military power fit into the legislative framework of the EU? How would the EU create a common policy encompassing all
    Member States’ policies in an effective manner?
</p>
<p>
    o If soft power is the preferred option, in which way could the EU increase the safety of its members with a common policy encompassing all Member States’
    policies in an effective manner?
</p>
<p>
    • With regard to the already existing frameworks, for example those of NATO, is it necessary for the EU to develop its own structures?
</p>
<p>
    o Should the EU look to improve its own structures, such as the <strong>CSDP</strong> and the <strong>Military Headline Goals</strong>, before focussing
    other frameworks, such as the <strong>Berlin Plus Agreement</strong>?

    <strong>Key Facts and Figures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Not a single EU Member State doubled their military spending between 2004 and 2013, while many states to the east of the EU did; Russia, Iraq, China,
    Afghanistan, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
    · Between 2012 and 2013, Central and Western Europe decreased military expenditure by more than 2%.
</p>
<p>
    · Eastern European states - pertaining to the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Albania, Hungary Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and
    Latvia – were spending 14% less on their militaries in 2012 than in 2000. Poland is an outlier in this case, increasing military spending by 50% during the
    period 2000-2012.
</p>
<p>
    · In 2010, Russia launched a ten-year weapons-modernisation programme, costing $720 billion, with the goal of turning the current 10% “modern” weapon kits
    to 70% by 2020.
</p>
<p>
    · Since 2007, Russia has almost doubled military spending, and during 2014 alone it will rise 18.4%.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        22 Member States of the EU are also members of NATO.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · NATO has agreed that member countries should spend 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence and should cooperate more to reduce expensive overlaps.
    In 2013, over all, European NATO members spent 1.6%.

    <strong>Key Conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The key underlying conflicts to this topic are of a highly <strong>ideological nature</strong>, and with regard to security and defence in Europe the
conflict is threefold: <strong>firstly</strong>, and central to the topic, as the advocate for peace and democracy that the EU is;    <strong>should the EU become a hard power</strong> in the international arena, or should it stick to the role of the <em>moral</em> actor in global
affairs, <strong>believing in soft power</strong>, through diplomacy, foreign assistance, civic action and economic reconstruction?    <strong>Secondly</strong>, is it the place of the EU to legislate on European defence, or if this is to be left to the Member States themselves? Does the
    European project extent thus far so to integrate Member States on a military level? <strong>How far should integration go</strong>, and is collective
    security part of the European vision? <strong>Thirdly</strong>, what is most affective in today’s international arena; <strong>soft or hard power</strong>?

    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Working top-down, the EU institution concerned most by this topic is the <strong>European External Action Service</strong> (<strong>EEAS</strong>), is
    equivalent to the foreign office of the EU. The <strong>EEAS</strong> manages the diplomatic relations of the EU with non-member countries. It aims to make
    the foreign policy of the EU consistent and more efficient, thereby increasing Europe's influence in the world. Furthermore, the <strong>EEAS</strong>
    facilitates the CSDP through a number of committees and agencies where the CSDP is discussed and practiced.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NATO</strong>
    , the intergovernmental military alliance signed on 4 April 1949. <strong>NATO’s</strong> essential purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of its
    members through political and military means. As already mentioned, 22 EU Member States are also members of <strong>NATO</strong>. Thus, the safety of the
    EU is of great interest to <strong>NATO</strong>, and vice versa. The EU-NATO partnership is today defined by the Berlin Plus Agreement, outlining how
    EU-led operations work, the level of transparency and mutually reinforcing capability, to name a few. With this agreement already in place, the extent to
    which NATO should be included in this debate pertains to whether the EU should develop the already existing partnership, or rather develop an EU-oriented
    defence project?
</p>
<p>
It goes without saying that the <strong>EU Member States</strong> are also key stakeholders in this matter. It is of great importance that    <strong>the Union</strong> is on board with the pursued actions and remains united. This is incredibly difficult, when 28 sovereign states with individual
    national and foreign policies, all with national interest as a priority: safety and prosperity. Currently, a <strong>Member State</strong> is itself in
    command of how to manage its national military; the EU has no standing “European Army”, nor the power to create one. But with the European vision, where no
    member should stand alone, are <strong>Member States</strong> truly only in charge of its own security? It can be contemplated whether the EU evokes the
    concept of collective security, in the pursuit of national security even if <strong>Member States</strong> are by right sovereign. Bearing in mind the
    greatly varying views on military and historical identity of <strong>Member States</strong>, is it plausible that there can be consensus on a pan-European
    defence policy? Must this policy even come at a pan-European level, or should <strong>Member States</strong> decide for themselves?

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>EU’s Common Defence and Security Policy &amp; the Treaty of Lisbon</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As declared in Article 42 of the <strong>Lisbon Treaty</strong>, the <strong>Common Security and Defence Policy</strong> (CSDP) “shall be an integral part
    of the common foreign and security policy” and provide “an operational capacity drawing on civilian and military assets”, which the EU can then use for
    crisis-management missions. The aim of the <strong>CSDP</strong> is to give the EU a politico-military capability for European-led operations and “shall
    include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy”, for peacekeeping and other military and security tasks, without undermining the
    importance of NATO as the provider of territorial defence for most Member States.
</p>
<p>
    There are many who look to criticise the <strong>CSPD</strong>, with relation to the phrasing of “<em>common</em> security and defence”. The Treaty of
    Lisbon, with aim to foster a closer cooperation whilst giving more power to Member States, did not change the manner in which policy formulation occurred
    for the <strong>CSDP</strong>; policy decisions are still by and large taken generally by the EU Member States themselves. Despite the call for a more
    collective and collaborated initiatives in the absence of structured coordination of national policies, the European armaments market remains fragmented
    along national lines.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lisbon’s</strong>
    legal limitations are illustrative of the lack of political will to create concrete cooperative initiatives that will initiate a transition from “defence
    policy” to actual “defence”. Whilst <strong>Lisbon</strong> has facilitated the practises of “softer” aspects of security, such as the Police and Judicial
    Cooperation in Criminal Matters, is has not created a relative platform for the implication of hard power. Ergo, the effectiveness of <strong>CSDP</strong>
    as a successful component of the EU’s response to global threats and a means of facilitating cross-national coordination of defence policy remains a
    “diamond in the rough”. This empirical analysis could also suggest that Neorealism – that emphasises the restrictive impact of the anarchic international
    system on the scope and depth of cooperation – has the strongest analytical leverage in understanding the <strong>CSDP</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Berlin Plus Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Berlin Plus Agreement</strong> refers to a comprehensive package of arrangements between the EU and the NATO. It allows the EU to make use of
    NATO assets and capabilities for EU-led crisis-management operations. The CSDP reinforced the need to establish a formal agreement between the EU and NATO,
    as with overlapping memberships of the two organisations and thus the concerns over duplications of assets, capabilities and structures, required both
    partners to agree on procedures for crisis management operations. The formal elements of the <strong>Berlin Plus Agreement</strong> outlines the framework
    of cooperation and clarifies the specifics of the EU-NATO partnership.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Treaty of Amsterdam</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Treaty of Amsterdam</strong> indicated the possibility of developing a future common defence policy for the EU. The inclusion of what became
    the CSDP was designed to enable the EU to adopt a coherent approach when addressing security challenges. The treaty subsequently states: “The common
    foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy
    […] which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide”.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Petersburg Tasks &amp; Military Headline Goals</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the Treaty of Amsterdam also defined the range of military tasks which the EU could undertake, namely the <strong>Petersburg tasks</strong>.
    Originally, this outlined three purposes for which military units could be deployed: humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks and; tasks of combat
    forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. The 2009 Treaty of Lisbon (Article 42) then further expanded these tasks to include: joint disarmament
operations; military advice and assistance tasks and; post-conflict stabilisation tasks. To facilitate the availability of the<strong>Petersburg tasks</strong>, following the Cologne agreement that the EU should possess an autonomous military capacity to respond to crises, the    <strong>Military Headline Goals</strong> were established. The purposes of these goals are to make it possible for Member States to deploy forces up to
corps level, and to ensure that the EU possesses the military capabilities required to conduct the full range of missions encompassed by the<strong>Petersburg tasks</strong>. In 2004, the European Council set a new target for capability improvement of the EU’s militaries, the    <strong>Headline Goal 2010</strong> (HLG 2010), which recognised strategic scenarios whereby the EU should be able to respond with a “fully coherent
approach” to crisis-management operations, as outlined in the <strong>Petersburg Tasks</strong>. The deadline for the completion of the    <strong>HLG 2010</strong> came and passed without the goals being met. Since then, no news Headline Goals have been set.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The European Defence Agency (EDA) &amp; the Pooling and Sharing Initiative</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>EDA</strong> is the Union’s agency facilitating defence cooperation among its Member States, and works to assist Member States in their efforts
    to improve European defence capabilities in support of the CSDP. The aim of the <strong>EDA</strong> is "to support the Member States and the Council in
    their effort to improve European defence capabilities […] and to sustain the <strong>CSDP</strong> as it stands now and develops in the future”. The Agency
is funded by its members in proportion to their GNP, and gathers the defence ministers of the Member States. In 2010, based on<strong>The Ghent Initiative</strong>, the <strong>EDA</strong> in conjunction with the Member States developed the    <strong>Pooling and Sharing Initiative</strong>, where the concept refers to initiatives and projects to pool and share more military capabilities among EU
    Member States on a national and voluntary basis, in line with defence policies of Member States. In December 2013 the European Council made a clear case
    for increased defence cooperation and welcomed the progress achieved by the <strong>EDA</strong> on <strong>Pooling &amp; Sharing</strong>.
