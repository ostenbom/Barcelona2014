    <em>
        With the appalling results of the EU’s agency for fundamental rights’ study into violence against women, how can the EU encourage member states to make
        a marked reduction in physical, mental, and sexual abuse of women?
    </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Chairperosn: Erdem Topcu - Turkey</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.”</em>
</p>
<p>
    - Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
</p>
<p>
Any form of violence against people is a behaviour that should by no means be tolerated nor accepted under any conditions. However,    <strong>many women keep on living under the shadow of aggression and abuse</strong>. These women, whose substantive rights such as freedom, honour, and
    safety are being violated, are exposed to domestic violence, sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced prostitution, oppression and physical abuse.
</p>
<p>
    Through extensive cooperation with national police and intelligence forces, the EU has taken many measures towards violence against women and women
    trafficking. <strong>Victims of women trafficking are eligible for financial assistance from certain EU funds</strong> in order to reintegrate into society
    through education, training and employment. Moreover, a number of projects tackling trafficking are also funded under the DAPHNE Financial programme to
    support NGOs helping victims, awareness campaigns, and law enforcement cooperation. Even though there are programmes that fund women’s refuges and health
    facilities, as well as efforts to change attitudes, little progress has been made in trying to tackle a matter of such importance as this.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, it has been noted that there is a linkage between domestic violence and poverty in developing countries. For example, if a household is already
    exposed to a certain level of poverty, in case of domestic violence, a woman is more likely to stay with her spouse rather than leave, fearing that the
    chances of her supporting herself are slim. Additionally, those women who decide to leave their homes are also face difficult access to the labour market.
    Many would suggest that fighting to lower the level of poverty that exists in certain European States will aide women in successfully evading and exciting
    violent situations.
</p>
<p>
    In 2014, European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) published its <strong>EU-wide survey on violence against women </strong>which was based on
    interviews with 42,000 women across the 28 Member States of the EU. The survey further affirms that violence against women is a widespread human rights
    abuse that the EU cannot afford to overlook. Results of the survey indicate that lives of
    <strong>
        a huge number of women have been affected by abuse, and more importantly that a majority of those incidents were never reported to the authorities
    </strong>
    . Should this not be a wake-up call for European decision-makers? This topic aims question what the EU can do to encourage Member States to make decisions
    leading to a marked reduction in physical, mental, and sexual abuse of women.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Terms:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Violence against women: </strong>
    Violence against women is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women. Including all acts of gender-based violence
    that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic suffering for women, incorporating threats of such acts, coercion
    or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, in both public or private life.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Physical Violence:</strong>
    The term physical violence refers to a bodily harm suffered as a result of the application of immediate and unlawful physical force. It also encompasses
    violence resulting in the death of the victim.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Psychological Abuse: </strong>
    Psychological abuse, also referred to as emotional abuse or mental abuse, is a form of abuse characterised by a person subjecting or exposing another to
    behaviour that may result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, chronic depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sexual Abuse:</strong>
    Sexual abuse is unwanted sexual activity, with perpetrators using force, making threats or taking advantage of victims not able to give consent.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Domestic Violence:</strong>
    Domestic violence shall mean all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between
    former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or have shared the same residence with the victim.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Victim:</strong>
    A person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss, which was directly caused by a criminal offence.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Perpetrator: </strong>
    A person who commits violent acts against women. Boyfriends and intimate partners are the most common perpetrators of violence against women.
    Acquaintances, such as friends and co-workers of the victim, are the second most common perpetrator of violence against women.

<p>
    <strong>Key Questions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What are the <strong>impacts</strong> of violence against women on the society as whole?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · What legal instruments does the EU already have in place to cope with violence against women? Are the <strong>existing legal provisions</strong> not
    enough?
</p>
<p>
    · What are the possible reasons for under-reporting such incident to the authorities?
</p>
<p>
    · What is or should be a man’s <strong>role and responsibility</strong> in achieving a reduction in violence against women?
</p>
<p>
    · How can the EU encourage Member States’ policy-making to further tackle violence against women?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Facts and Figures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Nearly eight in 10 women (78 %) in the EU think that violence against women is very common or fairly common in their country.
</p>
<p>
    · One in 10 women in EU has experienced some form of sexual violence since the age of 15, and one in 20 has been raped.
</p>
<p>
    · One third of victims of partner violence (33 %) and one quarter of victims of non-partner violence (26 %) contacted either the police or some other
    organisation.
</p>
<p>
    · On average, every second woman in the EU is aware of existing legislation concerning protection and prevention with regard to domestic violence.
</p>
<p>
    · Every second woman in the EU, on average, has recently seen or heard campaigns addressing violence against women.
</p>
<p>
    · In most cases of sexual harassment faced by women since the age of 15, the perpetrator is an unknown person (68 %).
</p>
<p>
    · Almost a third (30 %) of women who have experienced physical violence indicate a relative or a family member (other than a partner) as the perpetrator,
    and one in four women who have experienced physical violence (25 %) say that this involved somebody whom they did not know beforehand.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Various EU-bodies have called for <strong>concrete data on violence against women</strong>, and criticised existing discrepancies in data collection. There
    is an absence of comprehensive data on the extent and the nature of specific types of reported abuse. For this reason, justice systems are having
difficulties when they serve the rights and needs of the victims. One of the main conflicts which FEMM I is facing is the    <strong>requirement for concrete and comparable data across all European states. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The committee will also need to consider whether there’ll realistically be much that the EU can do considering the competencies that it has, or does not
    have, in terms of social policy.
</p>
<p>
    Until recently, in most Member States, violence against women was considered a private matter in which the state played a limited role. Only from 1990s
    onwards has violence as such against women emerged as a fundamental rights’ concern. Despite the measures already taken by EU-bodies, there are significant
    differences between national cultures and traditions that result in differing attitudes towards the matter at hand. While taking EU-wide legal actions on
    this topic, <strong>national and religious differences </strong>should be definitely taken into account

    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
    <u>
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </u>
    Within <strong>the European Commission, the Directorate General for Justice (JUST)</strong> has provided significant funding through the Daphne programme
    to address violence against women.
</p>
<p>
    In the Council of the European Union,<strong> the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) </strong>is responsible for most
of the gender equality decisions. In the <strong>European Parliament</strong>, the parallel body is    <strong>Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM)</strong>. EPSCO and the European Parliament established a European Institute for Gender
    Equality (EIGE) in 2014. This body collects comparable data for the Gender Equality Index. The index measures gender equality between men and women in
    different fields, including a ‘satellite domain’ on violence against women that “remains empty due to the lack of data”.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the NGOs, <strong>European Women’s Lobby (EWL)</strong> is the largest umbrella organisation of women’s associations in the EU. They do
significant work to promote reducing violence against women and leading campaigns across the continent. The EWL is the    <strong>largest umbrella organisation of women’s associations in the EU</strong>, representing a total of more than 2000 organisations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>National police and intelligence forces </strong>
    play a key role in this matter. The EU is fighting against women trafficking and cooperating with national security and intelligence forces in order to
    make a marked reduction in such incidents. The EU is combating this matter by strengthening cooperation and coordination between the police and judicial
    authorities of the Member States.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The most recent and the most all-encompassing regional instrument to address violence against women is the Council of Europe’s Convention on preventing and
    combating violence against women and domestic violence, <strong>Istanbul Convention</strong>, which was adopted in April 2011. All parties of the
    convention are obliged to criminalise physical and psychological abuse and sexual harassment, including rape. 23 states have signed and 11 states have
    ratified the Convention.
</p>
<p>
    Although EU law is in place to address certain forms of violence against women – such as Directive 2006/54/EC (Equal Treatment Directive) which encompasses
    ‘sexual harassment’, <strong>many forms of violence against women are not explicitly addressed through EU law</strong>. Almost all EU Member States that
    have legislation in place in the area of intimate partner violence also have some forms of protection measures in place for victims, including European
    Protection Order (EPO) which is in force since 10<sup>th</sup> January 2012 and the European Victims’ Directive establishing minimum standards on the
    rights, support and protection of victims of crime was adopted on 25 October 2012.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>European Women’s Lobby (EWL)</strong>
    has criticised the European Commission for not taking enough steps to reduce violence against women. Currently the European Women’s Lobby and its 2000
    member organisations in 31 European countries are campaigning to establish <strong>2016 as EU Year to End Violence against Women and Girls</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    It should also be acknowledged that since 2000 the Commission’s <strong>Daphne Programme</strong> has provided significant funding for civil society, local
    authorities and researchers to address violence against women in the EU. Its specific objective is to contribute to the prevention of, and the fight
    against all forms of violence occurring in the public or the private domain, including sexual exploitation and human trafficking. It aims to take
    preventive measures and provide support and protection for victims.
