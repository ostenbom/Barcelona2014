    <em>
        With the reporting stage of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive presenting a bleak outlook for European waters and coastlines, what more can be
        done to lessen the damaging human impact of over- fishing, littering, and climate change on Europe's seas?
    </em>
</p>

    <em>Chairperson: Sophie Hall – Switzerland</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    Europe’s seas are indispensable. Beyond their traditional value for transport, fishing and tourism, they are now also a source of minerals, oil, gas, wind
    farms, and communication cables. On a more elemental level, the seas and their diverse ecosystems are vital in keeping not just Europe, but the world’s
    climate stable. Mankind’s impact on the environment is increasing, not least in the marine environment. Agriculture, fishery, industry, shipping,
    urbanisation, space demand, tourism, energy production and mineral extraction all have serious consequences for Europe’s seas. Protection of Europe’s
    marine environments is more than an end in itself; it is also crucial to protect the economic benefits from trade, fishing, tourism and mineral supplies.
</p>
<p>
    With only 5 of 27 Member States without a coastline and the maritime area under the jurisdiction of Member States being larger than the European Union’s
    (EU) total land area, marine problems are truly common ones: both the causes and consequences of damage are shared between Member States, making
    cooperation essential.
</p>
<p>
    The complexity and interdependence of the marine environment make a comprehensive approach necessary; it is difficult to address any one issue
individually. However, this committee is asked to address three areas in particular: <strong>overfishing, littering, and climate change</strong>.    <strong>Overfishing</strong> can have a devastating effect, both environmental (as the size of the fish community sinks, so does diversity and the ability
    to adapt to environmental change) and economic (stock depletion can eventually lead to the collapse of the industry). The change in the fish population
    furthermore modifies the structure of the ecosystem. <strong>Littering</strong> both from land-based sources and ships is a growing problem in European
    waters. Beyond the visible pollution of beaches, it poses a serious threat to ecosystems, with litter degrading under water or plastics being eaten by
    birds or fish. Marine litter, especially from plastics, is increasing rapidly, yet there is a complete lack of national legislation to control marine
    letter. Though climate change is not included in the descriptors which make up “Good Environmental Status”, it will probably increase the impact of other
    existing pressures in the future. Even small changes in water temperature can alter the distribution of species and the acidification of the sea water from
    CO2 could affect both marine species and global CO2 level.
</p>
<p>
    The Marine Strategy Framework Directive of 2008 requires each Member State to develop its own Marine protection strategy to achieve Good Environmental
    Status (GES) by 2020. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive takes an “adaptive” approach, meaning that the goals must be reviewed every six years. With
    the Directive now in its sixth year, these reviews are looming and a first assessment of whether the overall goals and the strategies set by Member States
    are suitable and sufficient, and whether the strategies developed by Member States are appropriate.

    <strong>Key Terms :</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Good Environmental Status: “The environmental status of marine waters where these provide ecologically diverse and dynamic oceans and seas which are
    clean, healthy and productive” Article 3, Marine Strategy Framework Directive.
</p>
<p>
    · Marine Protected Area (MPA): Areas reserved, usually by legislation, to receive a higher level of protection, for example because they house endangered
    species or ecosystems.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Overfishing: When fish and other marine species are caught at a rate higher than they can reproduce, causing stock depletion.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Marine Littering: when human-created waste is left in bodies of water or coastal areas, in particular non-degradable substances.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY): the maximum annual catch which can be taken without reducing the productivity of the fish stock. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
· Climate Change: The long-term statistical change in the climate, particularly nowadays an increase in atmospheric temperature due to man-made factors.    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Ecosystem approach: An approach to environmental protection which involves consideration of all components of the ecosystem, recognising humans as a part
    of it, as opposed to a series of separate problems with a simple cause and effect. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Directive: A legal act of the EU which sets a result (e.g. achieving GES by 2020) but not how Member States shall achieve it. Each Member State then must
    implement the directive within a set time period (usually two years), which almost always means adjusting the national legal framework to fit with the
    Directive.<strong></strong>

    <strong>Key Conflicts :</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    At a glance, the area of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive seems very uncontroversial: the achievement of Good Environmental Status by 2020 is
    eminently desirable. But how realistic is it? As many other areas of environmental protection, the EU’s policy on its seas faces several conflicts in
    achieving its goals. Firstly, the common clash between commercial and environmental interests, with industries from fisheries to transportation and tourism
    hesitant to accept regulations which would damage their profitability. Environmentalists argue that if nothing is done, for example, to reduce overfishing,
    then the fishing industry itself may eventually collapse. This is true, but also highlights a key problem in such regulations: their successful
    implementation. Even though a comprehensive legal framework and strategy have been established on a European level, it is still individual actors, often
    smaller companies, or Member States, who must follow through those changes. Furthermore, there is a lack of a common understanding over the term ‘Good
    Environmental Status’ – how can Europe achieve a shared goal, if there’s no consensus on what this goal is? Successful environmental protection requires
    cooperation and sacrifices from all stakeholders. Despite the common good, such behaviour is extremely difficult to ensure because those who do not
    contribute to the benefits cannot be excluded. This is also true of Member States sharing regional waters, where one country which invests more cannot
    exclude those who offer less from the shared sea. The economic theory behind this understanding of overexploitation is called the “tragedy of the commons”.

<p>
    <strong>Stakeholders :</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first stakeholders are public authorities in both the EU and on a national level. Within the EU, the Environment Directorate General proposes policies
    and legislation for environmental protection and is responsible for making sure Member States correctly apply EU environmental law, ie. evaluating policies
    which have been implemented. The Commission uses target-setting to shape national strategies, which Member States have to develop themselves. It is the
    Member States who actually fund and implement marine protection measures in the strategies they have developed. Whilst the Commission sets the goals in the
    Marine Strategy Framework Directive, there is room for manoeuvre, which potentially could cause conflicts as Member States implement the goals differently
    and with varying success.
</p>
<p>
    As with all environmental issues, industry and commercial actors have a large stake in marine policy: the fishing industry is limited by quotas (derived
    from a total allowable catch or TAC), and its many, many producers whose plastic packaging end up in the sea. This also raises the question of consumer
    power, since it is consumer demand for these things which fuel commercial actors. Calls are often made for consumers to change their habits to be more
    environmentally friendly.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond policy-makers, international bodies also work to increase knowledge and understanding of the marine environment. The European Environment Agency
    (EEA), an agency of the EU, is a key information source on environmental issues for policy-makers and the public. The EEA advises both Member States and
    European Union institutions on environmental policy. On a global level, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), a network of
    scientists working for enhanced ocean sustainability, does research to offer to policy-makers, industry, and the public. The Institute for European
    Environmental Policy (IEEP) does the same, but as an independent not-for-profit institute.

<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    In June 2008, the European Commission adopted legislation on the EU’s marine waters in the form of the <strong>Marine Strategy Framework Directive</strong>
    , which sets the goal of reaching ‘Good Environmental Status’ (GES) by the year 2020. It is meant as a comprehensive piece of legislation to set goals for
    Member States to individually achieve within the four marine regions it establishes: the Baltic Sea, the North-east Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea
and the Black Sea. The Marine Directive also requires Member States to use the existing regional cooperation structures: the    <strong>Regional Sea Conventions</strong>. These are the OSPAR Convention for the North-East Atlantic, the Helsinki Convention for the Baltic Sea, the
    Barcelona Convention for the Mediterranean and the Bucharest Convention for the Black Sea. Where “practical and appropriate”, the Marine Directive states
    that the RSCs should ensure coordination.
</p>
<p>
    Next to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is crucial. Under the Lisbon Treaty, fisheries conservation policy
    is an exclusive competence of the EU, reflecting both the importance of conservation and the need for European cooperation. General fisheries remains a
    “shared competence” of the EU and Member States, so decisions are made mainly by the Council of the European Union. The CFP regulates many aspects of
    fisheries, including setting quotas in the form of a TAC for each country, fixed by the Council of the European Union.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in European waters, which protect biodiversity and allow for the recovery of depleted populations, set
    up under several international conventions. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive specifies that a coherent and representative network of MPAs must be
    created by 2016.
