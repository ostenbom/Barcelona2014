   <strong> THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT AND TOURSISM (TRAN) </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Building on the Urban Mobility Package: With approximately 70% of the European population living in cities, how can the EU protect the environment
        whilst embracing technology and efficiency, to improve sustainable urban transport?
    </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Chairperson: Teresa Stadler - Austria</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The world’s population is increasingly city-based and the existing mobility systems are close to breakdown. By 2050 the average time an urban dweller
    spends in traffic jams will be 106 hours per year, three times more than today. European citizens and economic actors need a transport infrastructure which
    provides them with seamless, high-quality door-to-door mobility. At the same time, many argue that the adverse effects of transport on the climate, the
    environment and human health need to be reduced. Urban areas account for some 23% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport and cities need to make
    more efforts in order to achieve the 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions set out in the European Commission’s (EC) White Paper “Roadmap to a single
    European Transport Area”. EU legislation on air quality and increasingly stringent emission standards for road vehicles seek to protect citizens from
    harmful exposure to airborne pollutants and particulate matter - but cities in virtually all Member States are still struggling to comply with the legal
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Urban Mobility Package</strong> was introduced in November 2013 as a <strong>guideline for Member States</strong> to better manage congestion,
    reduce road fatalities, co-ordinate different modes of transport and introduce greener technologies. The EC clearly states that implementation of its
    suggestions should be realised at the <strong>national, regional and local level</strong> to ensure that the actions taken match the specific
circumstances. In order to facilitate this process, the EC runs several platforms for national authorities to share best practice examples such as the    <strong>Urban Mobility Portal</strong> and recently allocated funds for the period 2014 – 2020 to be invested in urban transport projects.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, problems associated with urban mobility seem to have very obvious solutions at a first glance and many claim that the technology needed to
    make this sector more sustainable and environmentally friendly has long been available. However, <strong>numerous stakeholder interests</strong>, changing
    political landscapes at a national level as well as difficulties in securing the necessary funding to implement long-term Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans
    (SUMPs) make modernising transport in urban areas a complex endeavour and the evaluation and modification of existing measures imperative to guaranteeing
    results in the near future.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Sustainable Urban Mobility </strong>
        Plan - A set of interrelated measures designed by national actors with the help of an EC guideline. A SUMP aims to satisfy the mobility needs of people
        and businesses. It addresses <strong>all modes and forms of transport</strong> in a city and its surrounding areas and builds on existing planning
        activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)</strong>
        – Systems in which information and communication technologies are applied in the field of road transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users,
        and in traffic management and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Urban logistics/City logistics</strong>
        – The <strong>transportation of goods</strong> in urban areas which refers to three types of movement: (1) to industrial and commercial establishments,
        to tertiary sector or service industries (2) by individuals for shopping (3) other flows designated as “supplementary” flows generated by other
        activities such as transport of waste, the internal needs of public service, relocations, home delivery, postal service and hospitals.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Urban access regulations</strong>
        – Are measures to regulate vehicular access to urban infrastructure which can apply to specific places, types of vehicles and time periods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Transit privatisation</strong>
        – The process of shifting responsibility concerning the provision of public transport or services from the public to the private sector.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Public Private Partnerships - A business relationship between a private-sector company and a government agency for the purpose of completing a project
    that will serve the public. Public-private partnerships can be used to finance, build and operate projects such as public transportation networks.

<p>
    <strong>Key questions</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        With urban mobility calling for <strong>long-term commitments</strong> often restricted by typically short-term policy making on a national basis, how
        can long-term solutions and <strong>wider use</strong> of green technologies be achieved as well as the necessary funding be secured?
    </li>
    <li>
        Keeping in mind price, service quality and safety, is <strong>transit privatisation</strong> a desirable/ necessary option in achieving the goals set
        out in the Urban Mobility Package? Which <strong>other feasible option</strong> are there to better finance infrastructure modernisation?
    </li>
    <li>
        Many experts claim that new, <strong>green technology</strong> is already widely available. Why it not being implemented coherently and what can be
        done to achieve <strong>wider use</strong>?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · With all policies in the areas of transport, environment and technological development being <strong>shared competencies</strong> between the EU and the
    Member States and <strong>few legally binding documents</strong> on environmental regulations in this sector, how can already existing and new measures to
    better manage urban transport be implemented effectively?

    <strong>Key facts and figures:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Member States will have to spend at least 5% of their European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) budget on integrated sustainable urban development. Under
    the new rules, Member States have to prepare a Partnership Agreement (or contract) explaining how they intend to use the five main EU funds in a
    coordinated way to achieve the 11 thematic objectives linked to the Europe 2020 strategy. This should include their proposals for the implementation of
    integrated sustainable urban development.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from transport are required if the EU is to achieve its long-term goals. Therefore, the Commission
    carried out a study to investigate the sorts of policies and technologies that are needed to achieve substantial emission reductions by 2050.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Conflicts:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    One core issue is the <strong>competition for space</strong> between car users, public transport vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. With many cities
    failing to implement coherent traffic management which also connects different modes of transport, efficiency has not improved significantly over the past
    years. It needs to be understood that <strong>re-allocating limited city space</strong> is a tedious process which involves several stakeholders. This
    lengthy commitment is one that many governments are not willing to take on so that it never gets much needed attention.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, the <strong>lack of funding</strong> raises the question of <strong>transit privatisation</strong> which would substantially lower public
    expenditure and bears great potential in raising standards. With the profit motive at its core a private business has a greater incentive to invest in new
    technologies which would contribute to the EU’s environmental goals as well as positively impact efficiency and usage of public transport. Opponents of
    privatisation argue that governments should be responsible for providing basic services to prevent private monopolies and guarantee fair access for all
    consumer groups. Furthermore, privatised transport organisations are likely to ignore negative externalities related to transport since they are only
    concerned with one sector. Conflicting stakeholder objectives which determine whether they aim to maximise profit, performance or safety further impact
    private businesses’ actions.
</p>
<p>
    Debates on the topic often circle around the topic of <strong>how to best address urban mobility short-comings</strong>. Many of the proposed technological
    innovations are yet untested while smart, forward-looking solutions are needed now to better connect the ever increasing urban population. Delegates will
have to <strong>evaluate the Urban Mobility Package as</strong> well as identify ways in which environmentally friendly systems can be made    <strong>available to more users</strong>.

    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the policy areas this issue touches upon all fall under ‘shared competencies’ between the EU and the Member States. The principle of
    subsidiarity, meaning that measures are taken at the lowest possible level of governance, should be kept in mind at all times when dealing with urban
    mobility.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>European Commission</strong> as the responsible EU institution which needs to be addressed with suggestions concerning the modification of
        the Urban Mobility Package.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Committee of the Regions</strong> (COTER), is a main actor in pushing for innovative solutions, mostly in the area of territorial cohesion.
        In May it discussed the Urban Mobility Package and expressed its opinion to the EC.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-governmental organisations</strong>
        (NGOs) as well as <strong>private businesses</strong> play a key role in lobbying for their specific interests and can significantly impact the course
        of national action taken on this matter since neither action plans nor guidelines are legally binding documents.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Member States</strong>
        , as the Urban Mobility Package is addressed at authorities at national, regional and local level, which means that several layers of governance will
        be affected.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>European citizens</strong>
        play an important role in this matter since transportation should be tailored to their specific needs and their active participation in shaping new
        solutions is core to any project’s realisation.
