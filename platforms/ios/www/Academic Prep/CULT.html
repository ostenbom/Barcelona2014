    THE COMMITTEE ON CULTURE AND EDUCATION (CULT)

<p>
    <em>
        Despite the financial literacy initiatives of the OECD, World Bank, EU and national entities, over-indebtedness and a lack of understanding of basic
        financial concepts and consumer rights still prevail. How can the financial education of EU citizens’ be improved?
    </em>
</p>

</p>
<strong>
    Explanation and relevance of the Topic:
</strong>
<p>
    Financial education improves individuals’ understanding of financial products and concepts, and empowers them by investing in the development of the
    necessary skills to improve their financial literacy. <strong>Financial literacy</strong> emphasises individuals’ awareness of money management, income,
    savings, financial risks and opportunities. The abovementioned elements of financial literacy are aimed at (1) empowering consumers to make the best
    decisions given their financial circumstances, (2) protecting individuals’ consumer rights, and (3) being in charge of one’s finances.
</p>
<p>
    The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) started emphasising the role of financial education in combating low levels of financial
    literacy in the early 2000s and since then, incremental steps have been taken to improve financial literacy globally. However, the negative effects of
    limited understanding of financial concepts did not reveal individuals’ weaknesses to financial turbulence until the 2008 financial crisis and the
    following economic recession which exposed many households to careless financial decision-making, resulting in an accumulation of consumer debt across the
    EU. Such high levels of consumer debt have raised additional concerns about the possibility of rolling over debt, or accessing new sources of borrowing to
    cover existing loans. An <strong>over-indebted</strong> household has insufficient funds to meet its financial commitments; over-indebted households face
    difficulties in escaping a vicious cycle of accumulating debt to meet their financial commitments. The question of whether extensive or sufficient prior
    financial knowledge would have prevented many households from ending up in such a state arises.
</p>
<p>
    In order to actively combat lack of financial knowledge, many international organisations, and EU Member States have conducted surveys which have resulted
    in the undertaking of initiatives and projects aimed at increasing citizens’ understanding of the financial environment and its key concepts. The OECD has
    developed a survey instrument to address people from different backgrounds and various countries, in which it emphasises three aspects of peoples’
    comprehension of financial literacy: <strong>financial knowledge, financial behaviour, and attitude</strong>, and how they are interlinked.
</p>
<p>
The European Commission has explained the benefits of financial education for an <strong>individual</strong>, the <strong>society</strong> and the    <strong>economy</strong>. On an individual level, financial education may develop young peoples’ skills thus allowing them to lead an independent life, and
    make better financial decisions in accordance with their needs. Benefits for society include encouraging citizens, even those with low incomes to engage in
    financial planning and saving; two elements that diminish the potential of financial exclusion. Should individuals become financially literate, they are
    more likely to save and challenge financial service providers to develop products that correspond to their needs, having a positive effect on the economy
    on both investment levels and economic growth.
</p>
<p>
    However, the active role of international organisations yields little results as education falls under the exclusive competences of the Member States. Thus
    international and supranational organisations have limited powers in formulating education policy. Since 2007, limited progress in the provision of
    financial education and Member States’ inadequate response to decreasing levels of individuals’ financial understanding allowed for a negative spillover
    effect of the financial crisis on the microeconomic level, as consumers’ financial decisions were not optimal.

</p>
<strong>
    Key conflicts:
</strong>
<p>
    There are three main conflicts associated with this topic. First, in economies that are recovering from the recent recession, information is power and
    knowledge is key. Financial knowledge helps people and businesses in making smart and profitable decisions regarding their investments, spending and
lending, and helps guarantee that individuals’ consumer rights are fully upheld. However, there seems to be a    <strong>negative relationship between the growing need for understanding financial concepts, and the actual knowledge thereof</strong>. The current
    financial literacy initiatives in Member States are not sufficient enough and the levels of individual’s financial literacy remain low. Therefore, the
    conflict between the lack of knowledge and the rising need for understanding financial concepts needs to be corrected for with higher effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
    Second, households with low incomes, young adults, people with lower levels of education, and single parents are more likely to fall into a vicious cycle
    of over-indebtedness. Financial education has been announced in the European Commission’s report for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Europe as an essential
    component of its efforts to ensure that the Single Market can bring direct benefits to Europe’s citizens. Keeping the aforementioned aim as an
    over-reaching goal, many Member States have taken measures that involve enforcing certain financial courses into a primary and secondary school curricula
    e.g. <em>money basics.</em> Even though financial education from an early age is likely to yield the anticipated results for the levels of financial
    literacy, it is questionable <strong>whether such education should be compulsory or voluntary</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Third, education falls under the exclusive competences of the Member States where the EU has the power to merely assist. The task of enabling financial
    understanding through literacy initiatives is mainly up to the Member States. Even though many Member States have taken considerable actions in order to
raise the level of financial literacy,    <strong>a number of Member States have made little progress in initiating measures regarding financial knowledge</strong>. If the aim is the same for all
    Member States, to tackle low levels of financial literacy, then how to do deal with such discrepancies among the Member States as early on as possible?

<strong>
    Stakeholders:
</strong>
<p>
    <strong>Citizens</strong>
, and their capacity to comprehend the complexity of financial concepts, are the target audience of financial literacy initiatives.    <strong>Member States’ governments</strong> have employed different initiatives and strategies to increase citizens’ understanding of financial concepts
and elements of sound financial decision-making so as to minimise the potential of social exclusion and risk of poverty resulting from increasing levels of    <strong>household</strong> over-indebtedness. The highly integrated financial environment of the EU and the provision of mobility and market activity
    within the EU, however, require <strong>coordinated action</strong> and inclusive strategies aimed at increasing the financial literacy of individuals.
Hence<strong>, EU institutions</strong> and the resulting initiatives at the <strong>EU level</strong> are vessels of added value in the efforts of both<strong>national</strong> and <strong>supranational</strong> actors to enhance citizens’ awareness of financial concepts.    <strong>National organisations</strong> that are active in the <strong>financial sector</strong> may also provide governments with the necessary expertise
in formulating and implementing financial literacy initiatives. Such organisations like <strong>central banks</strong>,    <strong>financial associations</strong>, <strong>consumer advocacy organisations</strong> and decentralised government agencies are stakeholders that add
    relevant and appropriate input to initiatives aimed at empowering individuals’ understanding of the complex concepts and structures that govern financial
    decision-making.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, <strong>international organisations</strong> like the OECD and the World Bank should act as channels for international reporting and
    benchmarking of best practices. This would be in the hope that financial literacy initiatives that have yielded significant results are shared among
members of the international community allowing <strong>financial regulators</strong>, <strong>market stakeholders</strong> and    <strong>educational agencies</strong> to create inclusive financial literacy initiatives that are relevant, appropriate and have the capacity to develop
    the financial planning and decision-making skills of citizens.

</p>
<strong>
    Existing Measures:
</strong>
<p>
    The importance of good financial education has been acknowledged at both the international and EU levels. In the EU, initiatives such as the White Paper on
    Financial Services Policy (2005-2010), the May 2007 Green Paper on Retail Financial Services, and the European Parliament resolution on financial services
    policy, adopted in July 2007, emphasised the EU’s active attitude towards increasing citizens’ understanding of the financial environment.
</p>
<p>
    The European Commission has already taken some initial steps to address financial education. It has set up a website, <strong>Dolceta17</strong>, offering
    consumer education to adults. One of the modules on this site is dedicated to financial services, with subjects including budgeting, consumer credit and
    home loans, means of payment and investments. Another initiative is the <strong>‘Europa Diary’</strong>, a booklet distributed to second-level students to
    inform them of their rights as consumers. It includes a section on money, and gives early warning about the dangers of excessive borrowing.
</p>
<p>
    In 2009, the <strong>European Database for Financial Education (EDFE)</strong> was launched, which is an ‘electronic library’ of existing financial
    education schemes. In 2008 the <strong>Commission Expert Group on Financial Education</strong> was created with an aim to promote the exchange of ideas,
    experiences and best practices. The Group’s three year mandate came to an end in 2011, noting that the European Commission will focus on consumer
    protection and continue to monitor the many activities of the OECD.
</p>
<p>
    The OECD and the World Bank have both conducted surveys and published reports in order to best depict the current status of financial knowledge in the
    world. Their extensive reporting has given rise to many initiatives taken by the EU, but has mostly benefitted the Member States, who have created projects
    starting from ‘<em>debt-free through life’</em> in Austria to ‘<em>Portal del Cliente Bancario’</em> (Financial Watchdog) website in Spain.
