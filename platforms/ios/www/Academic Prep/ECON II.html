<p>
    With the EU’s stance on State Aid growing stronger in the past three decades, and tax policies such as the UK’s ‘Patent Box’ being questioned by the
    commission, how should the EU adjust acceptable State Aid actions to protect necessary causes and competition, without damaging Member States’ rights to
    remain financially attractive?
</p>

    Chairperson: Harm van Leeuwen – The Netherlands

<strong>
    Explanation and relevancy of the Topic:
</strong>
<p>
    <em>
        “[Without trade restrictions] the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord. Every man… is left perfectly free
        to pursue his own interest in his own way.... The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be
        sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the
        society.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    – Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book IV, Chapter IX, p. 687, § 51
</p>
<p>
    The <em>single market</em> is one of the most important pillars of the EU as a whole. It is underpinned by the belief that free trade and competitive
    markets provide the best basis for prosperity, through employment and economic growth. Free trade is established through the four fundamental freedoms of
    the EU: goods, services, capital and persons can generally move freely between member states. However, more is needed to guarantee the success of the
    single market. Thus, the EU was charged with establishing competition law: rules to guarantee a well-functioning, competitive market.
</p>
<p>
    There is a fairly wide consensus over the importance of free trade to the economy in general, and the internal market to European economies in particular.
    Even political parties that advocate leaving the Euro or the EU often argue that their country should continue to have access to it. In fact, several
    non-EU members are essentially part of the internal market through the European Economic Area and have agreed to apply many EU rules as a result. The
    existence of a customs union is thus not in itself controversial. Which competition rules should govern the single market, however, all the more so.
</p>
<p>
    Because the EU is an international organisation with independent member states, its competition rules need to ensure that neither firms nor governments
engage in anti-competitive behaviour. Therefore, in addition to rules to guarantee free and fair competition aimed at companies, the EU also regulates    <em>aid given by its member states to individual companies</em>. The general rationale behind regulating state aid is that it distorts competition by
    giving these companies an unfair and inefficient advantage over competitors. This is even more relevant for the EU, because member states can use state aid
    to give unfair preferential treatment to their own companies over those from others (a form of protectionism).
</p>
<p>
    In case a measure falls under the EU’s definition of state aid, the authorities handing out the assistance normally have to <em>notify</em> the European
    Commission beforehand. The commission then decides whether the proposed aid is legitimate or not. However, most state-aid measures are not subject to
    notification through the <em>general block exemption regulation</em>. This is an estimated two-thirds under the latest regulation (see ‘measures in
    place’).
</p>
<p>
    State aid rules apply regardless of the form in which the assistance is given—this could be anything from cash handouts to tax breaks to preferential
    treatment for government contracts. However, there is a large grey area of measures for which it is not immediately clear whether they classify as state
    aid or not, let alone whether they should be permitted if this were to be the case. One such case is Britain’s new <em>patent box</em>, which allows
    companies to pay a lower (10%) corporate-tax rate on profits earned from patented inventions. Last year, Germany’s finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble
    called for the patent box and similar schemes in other countries to be banned by the EU. The problem is that the scheme, rather than motivating companies
    already located in Britain to innovate, is designed to encourage them to re-locate there from other countries. For this reason, the European Commission
    declared Britain’s patent-box scheme harmful tax competition. Tax competition in itself is unrelated to state-aid rules, but now the commission has started
    collecting information to determine whether patent boxes in various member states can be classified as state aid or not.
</p>
<p>
    The central aim of the topic is thus to deal with cases like this: to decide which types of state aid should be allowed and which should be forbidden. A
    successful solution to this problem should not only find a balance between the key conflicts central to the topic (see ‘stakeholders’ and ‘key conflicts’),
    but also complement the European Commission’s existing drive to modernise and simplify state-aid rules (see ‘measures in place’).

<strong>
    Key terms:
</strong>
<p>
    • <em>State Aid</em>: aid given by a government to selected companies at its own discretion. According to the EU legal definition, assistance must meet
    four conditions to be classified as state aid: (1) it is directly or indirectly granted by the state or from state resources; (2) it gives an advantage to
    one or more companies over others; (3) it (potentially) distorts competition, e.g. by providing some companies with an advantage over others; and (4) it
    affects trade between member states.
</p>
<p>
    • <em>Single market/internal market</em>: the EU’s free-trade area with free movement of goods, services, capital and persons (‘four freedoms’) as well as
    common product standards and competition policy.
</p>
<p>
    • <em>Competition</em>: rivalry among producers to satisfy the needs of consumers, such that no producers or consumers have enough power to individually
    control the market. Different degrees of competition exist in economic theory, from hypothetical perfect competition to monopoly (a complete lack of
    competition). In modern economies, fair competition is thought to be essential for efficiency and low prices for consumers.
</p>
<p>
    • <em>Notification</em>: Under EU law, member states have to notify the European Commission of proposed state aid, so that the commission can decide on the
    legality of the proposed assistance. Many forms of state aid are exempt from notification through <em>general block exemptions</em>, for example because
    the amount of assistance given is relatively low.
</p>
<p>
    • <em>Patent box</em>: tax break for companies over the profits that they earn from patented inventions. This measure was recently introduced in Britain
    and the name is now also used to refer to similar schemes in other EU countries. This is not currently considered a form of state aid, but the European
    Commission is considering whether it might be.
</p>
<p>
    • <em>Harmful tax competition</em>: tax regimes that are specifically aimed at getting businesses to relocate the place where they are registered for tax
    purposes, for example by providing tax breaks only for offshore companies. All EU finance ministers agreed not to introduce such measures anymore and phase
    out existing ones in the EU’s code of conduct for business taxation. Harmful tax competition is unrelated to state-aid control.

<strong>
    Key questions:
</strong>
<p>
    • How widely should the term state aid be interpreted? Which types of assistance should be included in the definition, and which types of assistance, given
    on what basis, should not be considered state aid?
</p>
<p>
    • In general, is state aid a fair way for EU member states to promote business in their country or an inefficient measure that undermines the EU’s single
    market?
</p>
<p>
    • What is legitimate state aid? That is, for which purposes specifically is state aid an instrument that member states should be free to use and why? How
    well do the current exemptions regulations correspond to these needs?
</p>
<strong>
    Key facts and figures:
</strong>
<p>
    • From September 2008 to December 2010, EU member states spent €1240bn, or 10% of EU GDP, in state aid to the financial sector, aiming to restore
    stability. This was possible because the European Commission adopted temporary rules regulating this type of aid because of the financial crisis. The
    Member States pledged even more aid, but most of it was not used by banks and other financial institutions.
</p>
<p>
    • In total, in 2012, more than €67bn non-crisis state aid was handed out by EU member states. This is about half a percent of the EU GDP. Of the total,
    only €8.2 had to be notified to the commission. The rest was awarded under general schemes (which only have to be notified once, not for each individual
    case) and block exemptions.
</p>
<p>
    • Of block-exempted aid, the biggest shares went to regional development and environmental protection (including energy saving). Training, employment,
    small and medium enterprises, and research, development and innovation received much smaller amounts.
</p>
<p>
    • In 2013, only in 7 out of 269 cases did the European Commission decide to claw back state aid that was unlawfully given. A common reason for ordering
    organisations to pay back aid is because they got more than needed to achieve the goal that the aid was for, as happened to the German and Belgian post and
    a Dutch public broadcaster.

<strong>
    Key conflicts:
</strong>
<p>
    There are two types of key conflict when it comes to state aid. The first is between the interests of individual Member States and the interest of the EU
    or world economy. The second is a conflict between theory and practice: in economic theory, state aid is generally thought to be a bad thing, but in
    practice it can be a useful tool for governments to influence the economy.
</p>
<p>
    The dry matter of competition policy rarely leads to passionate confrontations between politicians. Yet in January, the French industry minister Arnaud
    Montebourg attacked the European competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia for his strict application of state aid rules. Mr Montebourg stressed that
    European companies’ competitors in America, China and Japan are already receiving billions of euros in state subsidies. He argued that in order for
    European companies to <em>survive among their global rivals</em>, EU member states should be allowed to respond in kind by selectively supporting
    businesses. In Mr Montebourg’s view, state aid is a suitable way of compensating European industries for unfair competition from non-EU states. Mr Almunia
    responded that, “Europe will not find its place in globalisation by launching a subsidy race with the rest of the world.” In his view, state aid does not
    offer a long-term solution for unfair competition from abroad. Rather, it would discourage European firms from innovating to become more competitive, and
    would potentially keep inefficient companies alive with taxpayers’ funds while causing more efficient ones to fail.
</p>
<p>
    It is helpful to look at the conflict of interest between individual countries and the EU as a <em>prisoner’s dilemma</em>, a theoretical way of thinking
    about co-operation. This way of thinking goes as follows. It would probably be better for the global economy if all countries agreed not to give unfair
    state aid to their companies: the most efficient firms would prevail while wasteful ones would shut down. However, it is tempting for one country to give
    its own firms an edge over others by handing out subsidies anyway. This would damage firms in other countries, so that these would now be better off
    handing out subsidies as well, rather than let their companies perish because of the unfair competition. In the end, consumers in all countries end up
    paying high taxes to support inefficient firms, so every country is worse off than they would be if no state aid was given by anyone. This is illustrated
    in the table below with Europe and America as hypothetical examples—to understand how the table works, have a look at the video under ‘interesting links’
    below!

<p>
    The second key conflict is that <em>between the economic theory of state aid and concrete cases</em>. As stated, state aid is considered inefficient by
    most economists, as it is seen as bad value for money, discouraging innovation and distorting competition. Yet in practice, member states would often like
    to use state aid to reach specific goals in their economies. These goals could be as varied as creating or safeguarding jobs, investment in socially
    desirable projects, or encouraging specialised business clusters. Many, but not all of these are allowed as exemptions under EU state-aid rules.
</p>
<p>
    The question is thus how to balance these interests. Can state aid be a legitimate way of attracting business and/or a sensible response to other countries
    handing out subsidies? Do state-aid rules deprive member states of tools to influence their own economy? Or is state aid infeasible as a long-term strategy
    to deal with globalisation?

</p>
<strong>
    Stakeholders:
</strong>
<p>
    The <em>European Commission</em>, the EU’s civil service, is the main actor in regulating state aid at a European level. It decides by itself on
    exemptions, procedures, guidelines and other issues in regulations that are binding for all member states. These decisions are made on the basis of
    extensive consultation with the other stakeholders. Some measures, however, have to be approved by the <em>Council</em>, the meeting of national ministers,
in a regulation of its own—for example when the commission wants to include entire new categories in its list of exemptions. The    <em>European Parliament</em> only has an advisory role.
</p>
<p>
    All <em>public bodies in </em><strong>member states</strong>, including national and local authorities, agencies, government-owned companies and more, have
    to abide by EU state aid rules. <em>Companies receiving state aid</em> will also want to make sure that the state aid they are receiving is legitimate: if
the aid is later found to be illegal by the European Commission, it has to be paid back. The final authority on this is the    <em>European Court of Justice</em>, however cases normally don’t reach this last resort. <em>Competitors</em> and other ‘interested parties’ are essential
    in enforcing state aid rules: when they think another company is receiving illegal state aid, and they are thus being put at a disadvantage, they can
    complain to the European Commission, which will then investigate. Finally, all <em>consumers</em> are stakeholders because when state aid distorts
    competition, they are the ones that end up paying for it.
</p>
<strong>
    Measures in place:
</strong>
<p>
    EU state aid regulation is currently in the process of undergoing major reform under the European Commission’s <em>State-Aid modernisation</em> programme.
    The commission has defined three major objectives: fostering economic growth, focusing enforcement on cases with the biggest impact, and streamlining rules
    and decision-making processes. The entire regulation system around state aid is being reformed so that it encourages member states to use targeted state
    aid towards specific growth-promoting objectives and controls state aid that significantly affects the single market by distorting competition.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to existing categories, the commission now exempts certain aid in its new <em>general block exemption regulation</em> (GBER) in the categories
    innovation, culture, natural disasters, sport, broadband infrastructure, other infrastructure, transport to remote regions and certain agriculture,
    forestry and fisheries issues. These categories were previously not part of the block exemption and always had to be notified, creating a high
    administrative burden. In addition, the commission is in the progress of publishing new guidelines for these categories to instruct public authorities on
    how to use state aid. Some of these have been finished, some are still in the consultation process and some still need to be started. The commission has
    also adopted a new <em>de minimis</em><em> regulation</em>, exempting all state aid below €200 000 (this amount is higher than before). Finally, it has
    started the process of better defining the <em>notion of state aid</em> through a consultation round in which public bodies and private companies are asked
    to give their opinion.
