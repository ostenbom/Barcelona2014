The Committee on Foreign Affairs has now been faced with this dilemma and is considering it as one of its solutions to the problem they have been given the task of solving. Throughout committee work, human rights appeared to be on the top of AFETs priority list, but what are the real consequences of completely shutting down energy trade with Russia? Can we supply the energy ourselves or will it just lead to further problems and an energyless Europe because of its will to change the legislation of a foreign country?<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAFET has first managed to highlight the problems of Russia being able to use their energy supply as a political tool and decided that they would rather find a different supplier or produce our own energy. In essence their solutions revolve around being able to force a change in Russian anti-gay legislation by creating a common European voice and decreasing energy trade between the EU and Russia, promoting change. To compensate for the energy needed, they are provide a wide range of energy alternatives and opening up trade in new, different ways.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne stance that must be considered in this situation is where the EUs democratic values lie. According to a Russian public opinion measuring agency an astonishing 88% of Russians support the anti-gay propaganda law . If the EU is meant to advocate democracy, should we be advocating the democracy of the people and respect the majority of the populations will, or should we deny that and advocate the human right to freedom of speech and the right to love. Is it even the EUs job to influence the education, and population of a country which is not a member state?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf we are cutting off trade with Russia because of this violation of human rights, should we not cut off trade with the 11 member states which do not recognise same sex relationships? Or the 7 member states that do not allow same sex adoptions? What about the 5 member states that have a constitutional ban against same sex marriage? Are we going to act like true hypocrites and try to enforce legislation in a country that is not our own when we have not even implemented this legislation ourselves?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Europe is potentially standing on a fabulously ostentatious gold mine. The question is, though, do we frack it or do we frack off?<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFracking &ndash; or induced hydraulic fracturing as it is formally called &#8211; is a technique in which water, typically mixed with chemicals, is injected at high pressure into a wellbore to create small fractures in underground rock formations. Any fluids, such as gas, released from rock formations flow back to the surface.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEnergy-craving Uncle Sam has been fracking away since 2005 with superb benefits for their economy. However, due to concerns over the large amounts of water used in the process, the risk of contamination of neighbouring water sources and suspicions of links to seismic activity, the technique has been met with much less popularity in our continent. At the same time, though, the extract of the process, natural gas, is much more environmentally friendly in producing electricity than coal and nuclear (currently powering 38% of Europe) as Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs) released when burned are significantly lower.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tENVI II recognises that no matter how much investment goes into renewable resources, they will still be a need for nonrenewable sources to power up the European grid at times when weather conditions do not allow renewable sources to produce at their maximum capacity. As explained in &ldquo;Watt about the price tag&rdquo; in our previous issue, generators running on natural gas the most responsive in changing their output at times when green energy is insufficient. This means that even as investment in renewable sources increases future, the demand natural gas will remain strong.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tENVI II has decided to allow fracking in the EU but to do so under strict regulation to ensure minimum environmental damage. The committee wants any fracking in Europe to be defined by outmost safety and to thus establish the use of the technique in the EU as a pioneering global standard for others.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe question the GA will be faced with is how Europe wants to deal with its gas. At the moment, 63% of Europe&rsquo;s natural gas is imported from Russia. When Europe&rsquo;s youth comes together to debate on trade as well as the environment, they should keep both the energy as well as the humanitarian aspect of trade with Russia in mind. Do the latest human rights violations fuel the need for Europe to grow more energy-independent? Do the human rights violations in Russia call for increased domestic energy? Does this further bolster the case for fracking?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCombining the course of action called for by both the AFET and the ENVI II resolutions, Europe could take a strong stance towards human rights and at the same time increase domestically produced energy and in turn become more self-sufficient Europe. Whether this direction is ideal is up to the delegates to decide, but in either case, the link between these topics is beyond question. Whether the EU should avoid fracking for environmental reasons, or ban gas imports from Russia is all up to the GA. Will the delegates leave the continent powerless?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p class=\"lead\">Decrease trade between the EU and Russia to twist Russian laws to our will?

Two children are playing &lsquo;Battleships&rsquo;. B5? Miss. C6? Miss. One of them secretly knows the other child&rsquo;s positions, as a friend is sitting 50 meters behind him with a telescopic lens and radio, constantly updating his mate on current Battleship positions. Wait, that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s meant to be played? That&rsquo;s cheating! Funnily enough this appeared to be the case when Der Spiegel revealed that President Barack Obama had allegedly personally approved of tapping German chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s phone calls from the American embassy in Berlin. What I ask myself, however, is why there was such a public outcry when spying is nowadays rather commonplace? If you were in the same position as Obama, why would you not tap Ms Merkel?<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter it was revealed that President Obama had knowledge of Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s phone tapping, the main reason that the media and the public reacted so strongly was the immorality of supposed friends spying on each other, especially that it was happening right under their noses in Berlin, showing that, according to the public, Obama should have immediately rejected such a proposal for the reason that the act of spying on a friend is immoral and wrong, as a relationship as important as that of the one between two countries should be built on trust. On the other hand, it is quite hard to find a place where there is more spying in a relationship than that of international relations, so why hide it?<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<br \/>\n\tIf we instead look at the realistic outcomes of this whole situation from the standpoint of the US government, we can see that on one hand we have people and governments having a lesser opinion of the US because of the tapping, but on the other we can see years of successful relations between the US and Germany which may very well be the way they are because Obama had certain information beforehand. Perhaps the increase in this type of information eased relations, caused trade and other agreements to be more beneficial for the American people and therefore that Obamas tapping of Merkel may have for the past years caused better relations and that they would have continued in this way, had they not been found out, which turned out to be the only real negative aspect of this.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<br \/>\n\tIf Obamas made the decision of tapping Merkel&rsquo;s calls, it may be seen as an immoral one when considering the two children cheating in Battleships and the seeming immaturity of it all, but when we realise the real outcomes of this and that America may very well be better off because of it, wouldn&rsquo;t you have done the same?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p class=\"lead\">What you must ask yourself is why there was such a public outcry when spying is nowadays rather commonplace?

For EU citizens, this means that they can work, live, study and retire as well as claim certain benefits in other EU countries. In the period 1992-2006, The Single Market is estimated to have created an extra 2,75 million jobs and increased EU prosperity by more than 2 percent of GDP by tearing down internal borders and cutting down red tape.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the two latest enlargements took place in 2004 and 2007, most of the EU-15 countries put certain restrictions on the free movement of citizens from newer Member States in order to avoid uncontrollable flows of immigrants. While migration to the EU-15 increased across the board after the enlargement, two major migration patterns took shape: Polish and Baltic flows to the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Romanian and Bulgarian flows to Spain and Italy. This is attributed partially to favourable labour market conditions, but, in the case of the UK and Ireland, it is also largely believed to be caused by the fact that they did not impose any transitional restrictions. Countries that did impose restrictions experienced a clear increase in intra-EU immigration when they expired.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor the countries that joined in 2004, all transitional restrictions have expired, but nine Member States still have restrictions in place for workers from Romania and Bulgaria.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThese restrictions will expire on January 1, 2014.Fearing that the lifting of these restrictions will lead to a significant increase in immigration and benefit tourism, Ministers from the UK, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands wrote to the European Commission calling for a crackdown on benefit tourism. There are also calls for stricter rules on intra-EU migration in general and a way to stop immigrants who have been expelled for abuse from coming back. At the same time, complaints have been raised that immigrants in the UK are being denied benefits that they are entitled to.\n<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tKey Actors<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the Ordinary Legislation Procedure, the European Commission submits proposals to the Council of the European Union and The European Parliament. The Commission is also responsible for implementing existing laws. Under the Commission, there are two Directorates General that deal with these issues, the DG for Justice and the DG for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion with the former focusing on safeguarding fundamental rights for all citizens and fighting discrimination and the latter focusing on free movement of workers and coordination of social security schemes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Council, the Justice and Home Affairs Council, where countries are represented by ministers in those areas, is responsible for most issues concerning free movement. Here, the UK, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands are trying to gain support for stricter rules on intra-EU migration. At a meeting in early June, the Council tasked the Commission with putting together a report on the implementation of free movement rules and how to fight abuse. So far no more countries have joined the fight for stricter rules and naturally, Romania and Bulgaria are fighting any attempts to restrict the freedom of their citizens. In the Parliament, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is the primary committee for dealing with these matters.\n<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tKey Conflicts<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tCentral to the issue is a dispute over whether benefits of free movement has outweighed the cost for the economies of Member States or if intra-EU migration has been a burden for the welfare systems of richer EU countries. The debate has been plagued by anecdotal evidence and hard facts are scarce since it is almost impossible to determine if a person is seeking to abuse the system or is simply unsuccessful in finding a job.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSince the economic crisis hit, the demand for government aid has increased at the same time as countries cut back to save the national economies. The crisis has also thrown cultural and historical differences of Member States into the spotlight which has caused a rise in support for nationalist and anti-EU opinions and parties and a discussion on whether Member States should not focus on providing for their own citizens first.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnother argument that opponents of free movement often bring up is that it puts an unreasonable strain on public services such as health care and education. The pressure is extra tough on local authorities where a lot of immigrants choose to settle and a lack of accurate data and predictions on future immigration flows makes planning difficult. Whereas migration is increasingly controlled on an EU level, welfare benefits remain the responsibility of individual Member States. Diverging interests arise where these policy areas intersect.\n<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tMeasures Already in Place<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tContrary to common belief, EU citizens do not have an unconditional right to reside in any Member State they like, nor are they are entitled to benefits immediately and without restrictions. Under current legislation, EU citizens have to be in employment, continually seeking employment and having a genuine chance of being engaged or be self-sufficient in order to be allowed to stay for longer than three months. Social assistance benefits are only given to EU citizens (and their family members) if they are employed or self-employed. EU citizens who are not employed should be self-sufficient and would thus not be eligible for social assistance benefits. In order to be eligible for social security benefits, EU citizens have to be either employed or self-employed or fulfil the &ldquo;habitual residence test&rdquo;.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe UK has unilaterally imposed tougher tests on foreigners through requiring that they fulfil a &ldquo;right to reside&rdquo; test in addition to the EU&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; test to establish if an immigrant is eligible for benefits or not. The Commission claims that this is in violation of EU law and has taken the UK to court over the issue.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCurrent restrictions in place against Romanian and Bulgarian citizens vary between Member States but include restricting access to certain professions, requiring work permits and giving priority to workers from other countries.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p class=\"lead\">How should basic EU liberties be safeguarded whilst considering the socio- economic pressures placed upon the welfare systems of Member States?<\/p>\n<p class=\"more-link-p\"><a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"http:\/\/www.barcelonaismedia.com\/fear-rising-benefit-tourism\/\">Read more &rarr;<\/a><\/p>\n","date":"2014-04-25 02:04:44","modified":"2014-05-05 11:51:13","categories":[{"id":3,"slug":"articles","title":"Articles","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":6}],"tags":[],"author":{"id":3,"slug":"gustaf-danielsson","name":"Gustaf Danielsson","first_name":"Gustaf","last_name":"Danielsson","nickname":"gustaf.danielsson","url":"","description":"Gustaf is one of the two editors of the 76th International Session of the EYP in Barcelona.

The world population is growing, global incomes are rising, and diets are becoming more resource intensive. While undernourishment and lack of access to food will remain significant challenges as they are today, the availability of food in the future is a global concern. According to the latest estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), agricultural production in 2050 will have to increase 60% over levels in 2005\/2007 to meet increased demand.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLand, water and genetic resources5are being degraded at an alarmingly unsustainable rate, and additional arable land and water is scarce. Faming is currently and will be increasingly challenged by <strong>increased resource competition <\/strong>and increasingly volatile and extreme weather patterns due to climate change. Increased production will <strong>require greater productivity <\/strong>to produce more from less land; however, <strong>growth in agricultural production is slowing<\/strong>. Intensified cropping and increasing yields will be necessary, especially in developing countries were productivity is relatively low, but this will come with environmental, socioeconomic and health costs, and require either the adoption of existing agricultural technology such as pesticides, or development of new solutions. In this global landscape, GM crops could greatly contribute to <strong>food security<\/strong>, <strong>food safety<\/strong>, and<strong> sustainable farming<\/strong>, but these benefits among others are counterbalanced by risks and potential negative impacts that have been widely publicised. To date, GM crops have already been produced for a range of purposes, including: pest or pesticide resistance for increased productivity and, arguably, safety (Bt insect-resistant or herbicide-resistant crops); increased shelf life for consumer convenience and reduced food waste (FLAVR SAVR tomato); increased nutritional value (e.g. &lsquo;bio-fortification&rsquo; and Golden Rice); or for the production of industrial or pharmaceutical products (e.g. industrial use starch potato, pharming).\n<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tKey Actors<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tA 2010 Eurobarometer survey on biotechnology revealed an overall suspicion of GM foods among the European public (see Figure 1). The same survey revealed <strong>similar levels of scepticism against the EU and the biotechnology industry, with more respondents believing that environmental groups were doing a good job for society <\/strong>(see Figure 2). The strong negative perception of GM technology by the European public is thought to be the major contributor to the politicisation of GM crop regulation, and consumer safety is considered the paramount concern in GM regulation. Consumers are represented at national and European level by consumer associations and networks.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.barcelonaismedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/sakipost1.png\" rel=\"\" style=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\"><div id=\"attachment_255\" style=\"width: 936px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img style=\"\" title=\"\" alt=\"sakipost1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-255 wp-caption aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.barcelonaismedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/sakipost1.png\" height=\"419\" width=\"926\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 1<\/p><\/div><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSix large companies have developed the vast majority of commercial GM crops. It takes on average US$136 million and 13 years to develop a new GM trait, inevitably restricting access to this industry to large, multinational corporations and incentivising them to strictly enforce their <strong>intellectual property rights <\/strong>on their developed products to recoup their investment in research and development (R&amp;D). The industry to date has mostly targeted farmers rather than end-consumers, and it has been suggested that the lack of public support for GMO&rsquo;s is related to the <strong>lack of direct benefits for consumers which could justify the potential consumer risks<\/strong>. Due to the <strong>stringent requirements and protracted timelines of EU regulatory approval for GM crops<\/strong>, many companies have stopped developing products for European cultivation and only submit dossiers in the EU for feed and food use of imported GM crops approved and grown abroad.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.barcelonaismedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/sakipost2.png\" rel=\"\" style=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\"><div id=\"attachment_256\" style=\"width: 934px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img style=\"\" title=\"\" alt=\"sakipost2\" class=\"size-full wp-image-256 wp-caption aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.barcelonaismedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/sakipost2.png\" height=\"425\" width=\"924\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 2<\/p><\/div><\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOften overshadowed in the debate about GMO&rsquo;s are the main users of the technology, the producers. Farmers are represented to European policy-makers by COPA-COGECA, a federative association of national farmer and farmer co-operative lobbies. GM crops are currently marketed with advantages for farmers. Additionally, the EU is <strong>highly dependent on imported animal feed<\/strong>, which often contain genetically-modified ingredients. The comparatively stringent regulation on GMO&rsquo;s in Europe can be a <strong>competitive disadvantage<\/strong>, and the current proposals to allow Member States more flexibility in national legislation has been opposed by COPA-COGECA as potentially <strong>restricting the internal market<\/strong>. Farmer opinions tend to <strong>vary between countries<\/strong>: in some of the six countries with bans on GM cultivation, a majority of farmers indicated that they would not use GM crops even if they had the choice, while in others respondents reported they would.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPolicy on GMO&rsquo;s and GM crops involve many institutions beyond those directly involved in the GMO approvals process. At the European level, the key institution is the <strong>European Commission<\/strong>, under which the most significantly involved body is the <strong>Directorate-General on Health and Consumers <\/strong>(<strong>DG SANCO<\/strong>), though other Directorates-General are related through specific areas of GMO policy. The European Commission is responsible for proposing new legislation to be passed by the European Parliament (EP) and the Council of the European Union, where the relevant configuration consists of agriculture and fisheries ministers of Member States. The <strong>European Food Safety Authority <\/strong>(EFSA), and to a lesser extent the <strong>European Environmental Agency <\/strong>(EEA), both independent agencies of the European Union, play important consultative roles in both policy making and implementation of policy. Member States also have their own national regulatory bodies to evaluate risks, implement policies, and participate in the EU approval processes. These are referred to in legislation as <strong>competent authorities <\/strong>(CAs) as their set-up differs between Member States.\n<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tKey Conflicts<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tThe controversy over the cultivation and consumption of GM crops is a debate over the acceptability of trade-offs and a conflict between costs and benefits. The main conflicts fall broadly into three categories: socioeconomic, environmental, and public health.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGM crops have tremendous potential to boost agricultural productivity. <strong>With greater precision than conventional breeding<\/strong>, GM can create crops with resistance to pests, diseases, or environmental stressors such as frost, heat or drought, enabling higher yields. Current insecticide resistant varieties <strong>reduce production costs <\/strong>by decreasing the amount of pesticide that has to be used, a reduction that is still significant <strong>even when the higher cost of seed is taken into account<\/strong>. However, the industry is controlled by large corporations, with foreseeable consequences including <strong>limited farmer access to plant material <\/strong>and <strong>intellectual property <\/strong><strong>rights slowing public research and expansion to developing countries<\/strong>. There is also the concern that GM crops benefit only industrial farmers with large monoculture farms in developed countries, and could have a <strong>negative impact on labour and employment<\/strong>. The current EU regime also has <strong>international implications <\/strong>beyond reduced competitiveness of EU producers, as the slow and slowing approval process for GM crops not just for cultivation but also import, processing, feed and food purposes leads to <strong>asynchronous approvals <\/strong>with an impact on trade.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt has been argued that GM technology is a crucial <strong>tool for sustainable agriculture<\/strong>. Insect resistant crops, already widely used worldwide, can minimise environmental damage from chemical pesticides. Other potential applications include engineering crops for <strong>land rehabilitation <\/strong>in saline or dry terrain, increasing <strong>shelf-life <\/strong>to reduce transport pollution and food waste, and <strong>biofuel production<\/strong>. Conversely, GM crops have associated risks such as irreversible <strong>gene escape<\/strong>, <strong>gene mutations<\/strong>, <strong>adverse effects on local birds, insects, and soil biota<\/strong>, and impact on <strong>biodiversity<\/strong>. As new technologies, there are also many unknowns and additional threats may emerge in the future. Opponents of GMO&rsquo;s assess these risks as being unacceptable, while proponents argue that these are manageable.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGM crops are often considered with suspicion by consumers and are considered &lsquo;unsafe&rsquo;, being associated with <strong>antibiotic resistance<\/strong> and <strong>allergies<\/strong>. The strict regulation in the EU is quick to address consumer issues, aided by the <strong>precautionary principle<\/strong>, but consumer perception often lags behind. Less well-known are the <strong>potential benefits of GM crops for human health<\/strong>. One clear application is &lsquo;<strong>pharming<\/strong>&rsquo;, where plants are engineered to produce medical products, but even in food production GM crops have significant applications. Insect-resistant crops, because they are less vulnerable to damage from insects, are <strong>less susceptible <\/strong>to fungal diseases that produce <strong>toxins harmful to humans<\/strong>. &lsquo;<strong>Bio-fortification<\/strong>&rsquo;, where food crops are made more nutritious, has applications in development in the fight against hunger.\n<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tMeasures Already in Place<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLegislation to date on GM crops fall within the policy area of health and consumer protection, and covers deliberate release into the environment of GMO&rsquo;s (e.g. for testing purposes), placing on the market of GMOs (e.g. for cultivation), placing on the market of GMO food and feed or food, unintentional trans boundary movements of GMOs, exports of GMOs to third countries, and labelling and traceability requirements. The last major reform and additions to GMO policy was in 2003, with evaluations on existing legislation carried out in 2009-2011 finding that &ldquo;the legislation&#39;s objectives for safety on health and environment and the creation of an internal market <strong>remain consistent with the needs of society, but are not being fully met as intended by the legislators<\/strong>&rdquo;. The evaluations identified key areas of improvement.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tApplications for the EU approval of a GM crop can be for cultivation, for feed and food use, or for both. Once a GM crop is approved at EU level, its use is possible anywhere in the EU, unless a Member State imposes stricter regulations on their territory, which is currently a possibility only under the safeguard clause. On numerous occasions, industrial operators or the European Commission have <strong>challenged Member State governments on their bans<\/strong>, arguing that they are unjustified; the EU has also been involved in disputes over GMO&rsquo;s at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The evaluation of legislation identified that &ldquo;the EU operates an approval system built on a science-based safety assessment for products that many in Europe, including several Member States governments, object to on socio-economic and ethical grounds. There is a general understanding amongst most Member States and other stakeholders that <strong>the use of national safeguard measures, while presented as having a scientific justification, is sometimes an expression of political objections<\/strong>.&rdquo;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRecent discussions at the EU level on GM crops have been about <strong>coexistence <\/strong>of GM and non- GM (conventional and organic) crops in European agriculture, the &ldquo;adventitious presence&rdquo; (AP) or &ldquo;low level presence&rdquo; (LLP) of GM ingredients, and allowing Member States to ban cultivation of GM crops in their territories for reasons other than a scientifically justified risk to health or environment.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p class=\"lead\">What stance should Europe take considering both their potential to boost agricultural production and efficiency worldwide of GMO crops?<\/p>\n<p class=\"more-link-p\"><a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"http:\/\/www.barcelonaismedia.com\/risks-gmo\/\">Read more &rarr;<\/a><\/p>\n","date":"2014-04-24 19:33:13","modified":"2014-04-28 08:03:08","categories":[{"id":3,"slug":"articles","title":"Articles","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":6}],"tags":[],"author":{"id":4,"slug":"saki-shinoda","name":"Saki Shinoda","first_name":"Saki","last_name":"Shinoda","nickname":"saki.shinoda","url":"","description":"Saki is one of the two editors of the 76th International Session of the EYP in Barcelona.
