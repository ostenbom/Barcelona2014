    <em>
        With the recent events in Ukraine highlighting the dangers of over-dependence on imported energy, what steps can the EU take to limit reliance on
        external energy sources and to protect consumers from price shocks?
    </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
    <em>Vice-President: Zahra Runderkamp – The Netherlands</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Explanation and relevancy of the topic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Energy is a key variable for growth and competitiveness</strong>
    . As of today, the EU is far from being able to produce the energy it needs to <strong>cover its own demand.</strong> Furthermore, the EU’s dependence on
    other countries for energy is increasing year by year. The EU is for a large part dependent on imported energy. <strong>Russia</strong> remains to be one
    of the biggest exporters to the EU. With that, energy has become more and more of a political tool, as most natural resources for energy production are
    getting scarcer every day. This also means that European economies have been exposed to energy price increases affecting consumers and industries directly.
    Therefore, <strong>political events have a direct influence on energy prices</strong>, leaving the consumer in a state of uncertainty. Over the past few
    years, we have witnessed several instances of EU’s energy safety being threatened by disruptions in Russia’s oil supply, particularly in 2006 and 2009. But
    there is also more historic examples: going back to 1973, the European economy suffered from an oil shock caused by the OPEC’s decision to radically
increase oil prices. With its large economy and limited access to fossil fuel resources on its own territory,<strong>the EU is constantly in need of ensuring a stable and reliable supply of energy and raw materials</strong>. To achieve this goal, the EU    <strong>continues to establish partnerships </strong>with producing countries, such as Russia.
</p>
<p>
    In 2011, the EU <strong>imported 60% of its total gas consumption</strong> <strong>and over 80% of its oil consumption</strong>. 36% and 31% of these
    imports came from Russia respectively. What these imports are made up of, can be seen in this graph made by Eurostat:
</p>

<p>
    And how has the importing of energy been growing? The European Commission shows it in this graph:
</p>
<img src="Images/image012.png" width="95%" />
<p>
    These graphs raise the question of <strong>what the EU could, and should, do to become more independent </strong>as far as its energy supply is concerned.
    With this question, the committee will also be asked to answer a more philosophical question:
    <strong>
        What do we want the future of our energy to look like on an EU level – what place do alternatives, such as nuclear or renewable, energy have?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Bearing in mind that the topic of energy security is already a priority on EU’s agenda, especially after changes made in the Lisbon Treaty, the topic of
    energy is an interesting one within the EU context; after all, it is a so-called <strong>shared competence: </strong>Member States have a right to frame
    their national energy policies, yet in responding to common concerns, such as ensuring a well-functioning internal market in energy and security of supply,
    along with implementing the priority European infrastructure projects, the EU needs coordinated action and interests, between Member States and the EU as a
whole, overlap constantly. Furthermore, energy is at the very core of the European project    <strong>: the original design of the European integration project was based on cooperation in the area of energy</strong> with the establishment of the
    European Coal and Steel Community and was quickly followed by the Euratom treaty.

    <strong>Key facts and figures</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>energy mix</strong> in Europe is on average made up of 35% oil, 24% gas, 17% solid fuels such as coal, 14% nuclear power, 10% renewable
        sources such as hydropower or wind energy. Please note that this mix varies widely across Member States.
    </li>
    <img src="Images/image013.png" width="95%" />
    <li>
        Today, the <strong>EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes</strong>. Energy import dependency especially arises from the use of crude oil (almost
        90%), natural gas (66%), and to a lesser extent solid fuels (42%) as well as nuclear fuel (40%).
    </li>
    <li>
        Energy supply and security <strong>concerns every Member State</strong>, even if some are more vulnerable than others. This is valid in particular for
        less integrated and connected regions such as the Baltic and Eastern Europe.
    </li>
    <li>
        The most pressing security of supply issue is the <strong>strong dependence from a single external supplier</strong>For instance, six Member States
        depend from Russia as single external supplier for their entire gas imports and three of them use natural gas for more than a quarter of their total
        energy needs. In 2013 energy supplies from Russia accounted for 39% of EU natural gas imports or 27% of EU gas consumption; Russia exported 71% of its
        gas to Europe

<p>
    <strong>Key conflicts</strong>
    :
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned, energy security lies at the <strong>intersection of policies on energy as well as foreign affairs.</strong> The question that remains is
therefore how Members States can work together effectively tackle the multiple challenges energy security poses. Moreover, we should ask    <strong>ourselves to what extent the EU should legislate on energy issues</strong> - is the EU a more coherent actor in this instance as one voice than as
    Member States?
</p>
<p>
    Another conflict is that under the shared competence, Member States work together “in the spirit of solidarity”, but the choices amongst different energy
    sources and general structure of energy supply are made on the EU level, choices for the conditions of exploiting their energy resources on the other hand
are in the hands of Member States. All in all, we can say that <strong>the</strong>    <strong>topic of energy, and especially of energy security, is fragmented</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="GoBack"></a>
    Another key conflict lies with the side of the <strong>energy supply.</strong> Clearly, big energy firms such as <strong>Gazprom</strong> have a big role
    in the energy security of the EU. Though at the same time this means that the price of energy is not very competitive and big energy firms can dictate what
    they want. Examples have shown us that <strong>the consumer is in fact not safe from price shocks</strong>. Price shocks are less likely when the market is
    in fact <strong>competitive</strong>, and there are various methods of doing so,,.

    <strong>Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Directorate-General for Energy (DG ENER) of the European Commission</strong>
        : the external dimension of energy falls under the mandate of Commissioner Günther Oettinger, in cooperation on some topics with the High
        Representative for Foreign Affairs, who can promote certain European preferences in energy, but DG ENER takes final decision.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>European Council</strong>
        : identifies strategic interests and objectives of the EU, on external action and also energy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>European Parliament &amp; Committees ITRE and AFET</strong>
        : Even though energy is a shared competence, under the Ordinary Legislative Procedure, the Parliament has to give its consent, for instance in
        international agreements made on the topic of energy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Member States: </strong>
        decide until a certain extent on their national energy policies and energy mixes. Member States have different energy ‘deals’ and import regulation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Energy companies such as the Russian Gazprom: </strong>
        being the world’s largest exporter of gas, Gazprom plays an enormous role in the question of Europe’s energy dependence on Russia
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Existing Measures:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Art. 194(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU</strong>
        (TFEU) sets out the <strong>four main aims of the EU’s energy policy</strong>. These four aims are: to ensure the functioning of the energy market; to
        ensure security of energy supply in the Union; to promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy;
        and to promote the interconnection of energy networks. The relevance of this topic lies with all four aims.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Regulation on the security of gas supply</strong>
        in Art. 194 (2) TFEU. This regulation <strong>notes some major problems</strong>: “With decreasing domestic production, gas imports have increased even
more rapidly, thus creating a higher import dependence and the need to address security of gas supply aspects” as well as        <strong>possible solutions and aims</strong>: “In order to reduce the impact of potential crises triggered by the disruption of gas supplies, Member
        States should <strong>facilitate the diversification of energy sources </strong>and gas delivery routes and supply sources”.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>20-20-20 targets</strong> set out, amongst others, the aim to raise the share of renewables (on European grounds) by 2020
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy</strong>
        : this roadmap gives direction to the future of Europe’s energy market, therewith setting the bigger picture in which this committee will have to look
        for solutions (especially in terms of the energy mix).
