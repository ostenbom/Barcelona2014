        <strong>Explanation and relevance of the Topic:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The result of the elections of the European Parliament in May 2014 shows a growing popularity of the extreme right and euroscepticism. Citizens grow
        more and more disillusioned with the EU, and the political sphere as a whole. As a result, one could argue that the EU does not appear legitimate
        anymore due to the disconnection between citizens and policy makers, that the belief in the ability of representative democracy to speak for all
        citizens is damaged and that there is a request for more participation of civil society and European citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the EU claims to foster a union of people and thus directly regulate for the people, tools for more direct democracy were only created in the
        2000s, when criticism of the EU’s democratic deficit arose against the “technocratic” EU. However, the introduction of the European Citizens Initiative
        in 2012 as the first real tool of direct democracy raises the question of the political nature of the EU.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, the European institutions still have not been able to initiate such a change in the institutional framework to move towards more direct
        democracy. Thus, the first question that needs to be tackled is what is at stake and why was there never any institutional change? What needs to be
        considered as well is whether the EU should aim to introduce more direct democracy or not? If you think so, which tools should the EU implement? Does
        the institutional set-up allow EU to be a (direct) democracy? Is democracy in the core of the EU?

        A video about representative democracy, which explains ways citizens can participate in society.

    <p>
        <strong>Key Terms:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Democracy: </strong>
            according to the work of Robert Dahl democracy is defined by two basic concepts: political equality and popular participation in decision-making.
            According to him, essential elements are required to achieve this: on the one hand, vertical mechanisms, such as elections, and on the other hand,
            horizontal mechanisms, such as the separation and balance of powers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Representative democracy</strong>
            : citizens of each country elect their representatives in European, national and/or regional parliaments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Direct democracy</strong>
            : aims to let citizens directly decide on policy initiatives, i.e. a direct involvement of the citizens in the legislative procedure as well as the
            use of the methods to bring the citizens closer to politics.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Active democracy</strong>
            : more active democracy corresponds to the fact that there is a will to introduce more participatory democracy in a representative democracy
            system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Democratic deficit</strong>
            : describes the fact that citizens are less interested in politics, and thus less willing to be involved. An example is the decreasing turnout to
            the elections and the general disillusion towards politics.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Policymaking: </strong>
            describes the process from the birth of a policy to the implementation of the law, including the vote of the bill.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>European Governance</strong>
            : the Governance of the EU is multi-level: local, national and European. This means that the decisions and actions can be taken in different
            levels.<strong></strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        · How could the voices of the citizens and the civil society be heard?

    <p>
        o By which means can the EU and the society dialogue?

    <p>
        <strong>Key facts and figures</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        · According to a survey published by the European Commission on May the 12<sup>th </sup>of 2014, 59Eo not have opeans the European Commission on May
        the 12th,% of the Europeans do not have trust in the EU. 32% have faith in the EU, while 9% do not express any opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        · In September 2012, the Eurobarometer found for the first time that more European citizens considered the EU to be undemocratic than democratic.
    </p>
    <p>
        · So far, 8 European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) are on-going and 13 ECIs have been closed. Another 17 ECIs have been refused and 7 have been withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
        · The turnout of the European Parliament elections in May 2014 was 43.09%. A study showed that people do not vote because they don’t believe it will
        change anything (64%), that they are not sufficiently informed (61%), that the European Parliament does not deal with their everyday problems (56%),
        that they are not interest in politics and elections (54%).<strong></strong>

        <strong>Key conflicts</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Improving the European Citizens’ Initiative</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even if it is too early to draw conclusions on the long-term effect of the European Citizens’ Initiative, some contradictions already appear.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, it seems that the more <strong>negative feelings</strong> an individual has for the EU, the less intention that person has to use the
ECI. Thus, the ECI does not <strong>tackle the problem of euro scepticism</strong> and unwillingness to get involved in its root.        <strong>The ECI is reserved to a certain group of the population</strong>; the one that has access to the information. As such, it does not necessarily
        bring more direct democracy because it makes the citizens unequal in front of such tool. As Pierre Rosanvallon said ‘we thought democracy is about
        participation but actually it is about equality’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Emily O'Reilly is currently working on a<strong> feedback of the European Citizens’ Initiative </strong>that will be submitted to the European
        Commission.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Is the EU a democracy?</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
It seems that to answer the question “<strong>why citizens fail to use the tools they have</strong>”, we have to turn ourselves towards the        <strong>lack of salience</strong>. Indeed, the EU does not have the power of initiative in every field of the decision-making. Due to the reluctances
        to give more powers to the EU from Member States, the EU might not be capable to foster a real political participation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, historically, the EU was never supposed to become a democracy, but rather a tool to better cooperates between a few countries on an
        economy level. In this perspective, we can wonder whether it is really necessary to bring the EU closer to the citizens because it is not its first
        task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, the EU might not be capable to live up to the expectations: there is a lack of political life in the EU (and lack of mediatisation of such a
        life), policy makers are not being elected except for the European Parliament, which is rather seen as a ‘second order national contest’ and for whom
        election is strongly depending on the national performance of the government.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Moravcsik, “Legislative and regulatory activity is inversely correlated with the salience of issues in the minds of European voters, so
any effort to expand participation is unlikely to overcome apathy<strong>”. </strong>As a matter of fact, it appears that        <strong>any move towards more participation - referendums, elections - based on EU issues might encourage the impoverishment of the EU.</strong> There
        is as well a risk that by allowing more participation, the quality of the law would decrease and the policy making process will be less efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        A solution might be to <strong>give individuals a reason to care about EU politics </strong>- it appears necessary to give them a stake in it - such as
        the feeling of a united European people, that the EU wants to build but still fails at doing. Whereas it is for the ECI or for any further tool that
        wants to bring the EU closer to the citizens, <strong>what should be the first question is why is there such a democratic deficit</strong>?

        <strong>European Citizenship</strong>
        (article 20 TFUE) allows every citizen to vote and to be elected to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage since 1976. Since the Treaty
        of Maastricht in 1993, every citizen has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in the local and regional elections.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2000, the <strong>White Book on the Reform of the EU governance</strong> decided to orientate the democratic issue towards citizens and civil
        society by:
    </p>
    <p>
        · Taking into account the reinforced participation of the “civil society”;
    </p>
    <p>
        · Set up the objective to make the decision-making process more open and transparent;
    </p>
    <p>
        · The definition of “civil society” became more inclusive, including not only NGOs but also “trade unions and employers’ organizations (“social
        partners”); . . . professional organizations; charities; grass-roots organizations that involve citizens in local and municipal life with a particular
        contribution from churches and religious communities”
    </p>
    <p>
The <strong>Treaty of Lisbon</strong>, in effect from 2009, is a reference moment towards more direct democracy. The article 10.3 TEU stipulates,        <strong>“every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union”, </strong>while:

            The <strong>European Citizens’ Initiative</strong>, that took effect on April 1, allows the citizens to be “co-authors of the law”: if a measure
            gathers up to one million signatures coming from at least 7 out of the 28 Member States, it will be addressed to the European Commission. However,
            such initiatives can only be taken into the secondary EU legislation, i.e. not the treaties of the EU.

        The Member States can decide to hold a <strong>referendum on EU issues</strong>. However, expressing its view is limited to a pro or cons opinion.

In 2006, the European Movement France launched a petition that aimed to gather one million signatures in order to create a        <strong>European Civil Service</strong>, which would allow every young European to engage in a project of solidarity in another Member state of the EU.
        The European Civil Service is today one tool to bring the EU closer to its citizens.

        Moreover, there are a few initiatives. For example, the network <strong>Democracy International introduced a paper “More democracy in Europe”</strong>
        in 2005, calling for more direct democracy. They called for a <strong>new EU convention</strong> where big decisions would be taken in an open debate
        between politicians, civil society and citizens. Furthermore, obligatory referenda would take place in case of a transfer of sovereignty and treaty
        amendments. Heidrun Abromeit proposed mandatory referenda in case of new treaties and amendments, as well as direct-democratic instruments such as veto
        rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, <strong>Michael Nentwich</strong> proposes a European indirect popular initiative – similar to what exists in Switzerland. 3-4% of the
        electoral in at least five Member States could submit a proposal to the Council and the Parliament. If they refuse to enact the law, a European-wide
        referendum will take place.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can as well consider the <strong>Internet and social media as platform for discussions</strong>, as we have seen the impact that it can have to a
        certain extend during the Arab Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
        It appears necessary to as well keep in mind <strong>the involvement of lobbying and interest groups in the process of policy making</strong> on a
        European level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those measures are just examples among many, and you are welcome to do any further research.

        Democracy International is an international network that promotes direct democracy. In this article, they are explaining their call for a new EU
        Convention, and you can see a case of petitions as a tool to raise the citizens’ voice.
